<p>Friends: if you stand on the seashore when the tide is
flowing inwards, and if you watch the waves as they
ripple up, one after another, each coming a little further
than its predecessor, each in turn breaking and making
way for its follower—in the inflowing tide you have a
picture of the evolving races of mankind. And if you
watch the method of the flow, you will notice that that
which is the most prominent at the moment is not the
one which creeps furthest up the sands. The wave
which is breaking into foam, which is rippling over the
pebbles, which throws up the broken water, which falls
back on to the land and makes music, sound, melody
as it breaks—that is the wave which is nearly over; it
is the wave whose course is run. But if you watch you
will notice that while your attention was caught by the
noise of the breaking wave, by the foam of the billow
that was almost over, silently, imperceptibly almost,
visible only to the eye that watches, another wave is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
rising behind it, silently, without break, without noise,
without attracting attention; but the wave that is rising
silently behind the breaker—that is the wave which
will follow on the billow that has broken, and will run
further up the sands than the breaking wave had
gone.</p>

<p>In that familiar picture, which every child who has
gone to the seaside knows so well, is a figure of the
great tide of evolution, in which races are waves and the
ocean humanity itself. And each great wave—the great
wave that comes at intervals—is a race, and the smaller
waves that come between are the sub-races which the
race bears. Just as with the water, so with humanity:
as one sub-wave is breaking, having reached its highest
point, another is rising silently behind it, which shall
rule the world when the breaking wave has spent its
force. Then, from time to time, to those who have eyes
to see, on the crest of the breaking wave appears the
mighty angel that we call the Spirit of the Age, and his
feet are on the wave, and his locks mingle with the rays
of the sun, and he cries out in a voice of thunder: Behold
I make a new heaven and a new earth in which
righteousness shall dwell.</p>

<p>In such a day, in such a time, we of the present age
are living. The wave of the sub-race to which we all
belong, or nearly all of us, <em>that</em> is breaking on the shore
of time; the wave behind it of the race that shall be,
to whom the new heaven and the new earth shall be a
habitation—<em>that</em> is the race which is coming to the birth,
which, in its turn, shall rule this changing earth. For
many and many a century, nay, even for millennia, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
slow course of evolution goes on quietly without much
observation, and then suddenly comes a change—a
change of a dying and a birthing race, a transition stage,
a transition age in which all movement is rapid, in which
catastrophes are frequent, in which sudden changes
make themselves felt, in which men grow in a year
more than their forefathers grew perhaps in a century.
In such a transition age again the world is standing at
the present time. Behind us, the long centuries through
which the great Aryan race has been sending out wave
after wave of humanity in successive billows, sweeping
over Asia and over Europe, one after another rising,
growing, ruling, and then passing to its fall. During all
the time of a sub-race, the world rolls down what have
been called the grooves of change, steadily, quietly, without
much of jolt or of trouble; the wheels running
fairly smoothly, continuously, with little of shock. And
then, again, the time comes when a new sub-race must
be born, when another shall succeed and the old shall
pass away.</p>

<p>If you look around you now, on every side you will
see the signs of a closing age; thoughts which have
reached a point beyond which they cannot continue on
the old lines and in the old methods, that which I have
called a deadlock; in all the most important departments
of human thought and human activity, rapid, extraordinarily
rapid, growth. The changes which the elder
amongst us have seen are marvellous exceedingly,
change succeeding change, and each change greater
than the one before it, until the whole of society seems
to be rushing onwards swiftly without a pause, and men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
wonder what the next thought will be, what the next
development will forebode.</p>

<p>It is not, of course, for the first time in human history
that such a period as this has come upon the world.
Look back to the time when the sub-race preceding the
Teutonic was at the zenith of its power, and see then
how troubled were the minds of men. It was the time
that was marked by the birth of Him who is known in
western lands as the Christ—a period of swift transition
like our own, of marked and sudden changes. And if to
the people of that day you had said, as I am now saying
to you: “You are in one of the great transition periods
of the world’s history; the race that is dominant and
imperial is really reaching its zenith, and after the
zenith comes the slow descent, inevitable, sure”; if you
had said to the people of the time that among them
would come a mighty Teacher who should revolutionise
the future world and change the very foundations of
civilisation; who should change the type of religion for
the foremost races of the world; who should lift up a different
ethical code, and make that virtuous which before
had been despised, and that which had been looked
down upon the topmost crown of saintship—if to the
people of that day you had spoken such words, they
would have laughed at you as dreamer or threatened you
as madman. For why should the world change on its appointed
ways, and why should the feet of the world seek
to tread new and untrodden paths? And yet there were
many who felt a change was coming; yet there were
prophets and seers who spoke of a coming kingdom and
a coming Teacher, and changes which should alter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the face of the world. Of little use to look back to
those far-off times if you repeat in your own day the
blindness of the people then; for surely in these two
thousand years men should have learned something
more of wisdom, their eyes should have gained something
more of insight, and the signs of a closing age
should be more palpable to them than in the days of
their forerunners in the closing age of Rome.</p>

<p>Even at that time a future was spoken of where
changes should again occur, where a great Teacher
should again appear, where a new age should be born,
a new heaven and a new earth should be seen. It is in
that next transition age, then, that you and I are standing;
and although many of you may say, as they would
have said of old, that I am a dreamer or am mad, none
the less will I strive to tell you this evening, and the
Sundays that follow, something of the signs by which
you may judge for yourselves whether a great change
is not coming over the world, whether there is not
coming a new kingdom and a mighty Teacher, whether
in our days again, as in the days of the past, the world is
not to take on a new form and a nobler type of humanity
to live and rule on earth, for many are the signs of
the age that is closing, and many the signs also of the
day that is dawning upon earth. In this and in the following
lecture we shall be dealing with the dying, not the
race which is to be born; and if in some ways, therefore,
these two lectures may seem a little gloomy or a little
grey, then I would remind you that the night must come
before the dawn, and the greyness of the sky before the
sunrising. If we can see behind the greyness the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
faint gleams of the rose-tipped fingers of the dawn, ah!
then we need not mind that the night is still with us,
for the night is closing, and we, the children of the day,
shall see the rising of the sun.</p>

<p>I have taken for this evening three great departments
of human thought—Religion, Science, Art; and our
task now is to see whether, looking over the world of
religion, of science, and of art, we can find that the old
methods have carried us as far as we can go, that they
are breaking in our hands, that we no longer can use
them for opening up new vistas of thought and hope
for man. On every side there is a feeling of uncertainty,
a feeling, I might almost say, of distress; a questioning
what is truth, what is reliable? where can we
find some rock on which we may put our feet amid all
the buffeting of various opinions, of doubt, nay, of
scepticism and unbelief?</p>

<h4>I.—<span class="smcap">Religion.</span></h4>

<p>What is the position of the religious world to-day?
First of all, there have been working in it now for many
long years certain forces undermining the religion of the
time; and when I speak now of religion, I mean the religion
of the West, for I am speaking in the West; although
I might show you that in other parts of the world
as well the same forces are at work, though not quite
so prominently, and have brought about there to some
extent the same results. Now, it is not from the mouth
of a Theosophist like myself that I would ask you to
take the testimony as to the difficulties in which the
religious world finds itself to-day, and on the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
important points of which I shall touch, after drawing
your attention to the destructive forces that have been
undermining religion, I shall take my testimony from
bishop and from clergyman in their published writings,
which all may read who will. The undermining forces
that I allude to are chiefly three, and each destructive;
the absence of construction is one of the signs of the
day that is closing. First, as you know well, the undermining
which has been done by scholarship in Christendom,
in which what is called the higher criticism has
been tearing to pieces the documents on which historical
Christianity has been built up—taking one after another,
examining, studying, scrutinising, comparing one
kind of language with another kind in the same document;
pointing out marks of different ages where a
single writer was supposed to have been speaking, and
gradually collecting from all sides different readings,
placing them side by side, and finding them to a very
great extent mutually destructive. So far has that gone,
as you know, that, not so very long ago, the whole of this
line of investigation was condemned by the authoritative
head of the great Roman Catholic communion. The
higher criticism, the historical dealing with Church teaching
and Church history, the analysing, scrutinising, investigating
spirit of our own time—the whole of that,
with all its results, has been condemned and forbidden to
be taught within the teaching establishments of the great
Roman communion; the results of historical criticism
have been banned, and, most fatal of all policies, kept
largely out of the knowledge of those who are to become
the teachers of the generations that are to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
born. Is there any wonder, if you look at it only from
the outside point? For where religion is a matter of
authority, of books, of successions, of historical events,
there criticism must always destroy; the form changes,
and cannot remain stable in a transitory world, and we
find the ancient documents shorn of their ancient value;
we find inspiration, limited and fettered to words instead
of the spirit, failing to hold its own against the critical
scholarship of the day. One defence after another is
thrown up, only to be abandoned before the approaching
tide, as children throw up castles in the sand, dreaming
that sand castles can stop the flow of waves. You know,
on every side questions have arisen in regard to documents;
most disheartening and discouraging if religion
were a matter of books and words, and not a matter of
the living and divine spirit in man, which no criticism is
able to destroy. For, out of it all, thought arises and all
criticism itself has birth. But, for the moment, in that
tearing to pieces of the documents, one great inroad is
made on the religion of the time.</p>

<p>Then, if you turn to another destructive force that
has been undermining popular religion, you find it in
archæological research; you find it in what is called comparative
mythology, built up out of the results of that
research; unburied cities, unburied libraries, unburied
tombs—they have all given up their longhidden secrets,
and those secrets have been used as weapons against
the religion of the West. Dates have been thrown
overboard, hundreds of years have been lengthened
into millions; archæology, geology, antiquarianism
of every kind, researches into long-dead races<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
have all given the same result, shaking the very foundations
on which it was thought, however wrongly, that
religion must be built. Out of all this undermining, this
destruction, from the continuously critical spirit of man,
have arisen doubt and question and half-scepticism, and
only a hope instead of a knowledge, only an aspiration
instead of a living faith. And beyond those minor questions
of religion which can be touched by this kind of
destructive criticism, beyond and above those, the central
ideas of religion have been thrown into the Crucible
of Reason. The idea of God Himself has been under
discussion, argued about, reasoned about, and the conception
of God has changed. Who now dreams of
troubling himself much about Butler’s <cite>Analogy</cite>? Who
now would spend his time poring over Paley’s <cite>Evidence</cite>?
These are out of date, and they do not deal with the
questions of the time; for the thought of Evolution has
affected religion, and the central conception of Deity has
not been able to escape the corrosion of that atmosphere
of thought. Here, again, outward demonstrations are
failing, outward reasonings fail to satisfy. Reason,
though piled upon reason, can give no more than a
reasonable probability, so long as you watch for God
only in the outer world, and not in His highest manifestation,
the Spirit which lives in yourself. The idea of
an extra-cosmic God is gradually disappearing from the
world of thought. The idea of a God who made the
universe as a piece of machinery, and stood outside it
while the wheels were turning and the bands were
working—that idea has almost passed away; and instead
of that a God immanent in everything, a God who is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
life and not a mechanician, a God who is an informing
Spirit and not an outside creator—that nobler, more
exquisite idea is dawning on the religious world to-day.
But still, to see Him only immanent in the universe,
that is not the final answer of religion; there is something
more that is needed than the God who is found
within the universe and within man, that mighty truth
which is spoken out in an Eastern scripture: “I established
this universe with a portion of Myself, and I remain.”
That is one of the new avenues of thought, of
escape from the destructive forces of the thought that
we are considering.</p>

<p>Along another of the great Christian concepts there is
much of trouble and of difficulty to-day. I take here, for
a moment, one of a series of remarkable articles that
appeared in the <cite>Hibbert Journal</cite> for January last, one
perhaps of the finest numbers that have been issued, dealing
with this question of the time. One of these articles
has a strange title which marks out the crux of many a
mind to-day; the title is, “Jesus or Christ?”; not “Jesus
Christ,” not “Jesus and Christ,” but “Jesus <em>or</em> Christ?”;
natural enough if it were written by a Theosophist, but
this is written by a minister of a Christian church, and
he confesses, with wonderful candour and boldness, the
difficulties that all must face who are dealing on the one
side with a spiritual ideal and on the other with a man.
He asks whether the claims made are on behalf of a
spiritual ideal, to which provisionally the word “Christ”
may be applied, or are they predicated of Jesus; he then
goes through a number of these difficulties (many of you
would do well to read the article at your leisure), pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
out in how many cases in the New Testament you come
across limitations, acceptance of the thought of the time,
and many other difficulties which clash with the idea that
this was Very God of Very God. “No condemnation,” he
points out, “in the Sermon on the Mount is passed on
the harsh and cruel law of debtor and creditor, nor would
efforts for legal reform find any encouragement from the
words attributed to the Master here. On non-resistance
and oath-taking the rule attributed to Jesus is absolute.
Yet, as a whole, Christendom has openly violated it
throughout its history.” He then speaks of the view
which is taken of man in relation to woman, of the
“iniquitous principle of sex-inferiority as against woman,”
a principle that “has inflicted infinite suffering on
half of the human race.” And so he goes on, taking up
point after point, and declaring that this conclusion can
no longer be avoided—that to identify Jesus with Christ
is to “make God a Being who is omnipotent, yet limited
in power; omniscient, yet defective in knowledge; infinitely
good, yet One who declines ‘to turn any part of His
knowledge as God into science for man.’ … It would
be an abuse of language to say that this is a mystery.
It is flat contradiction.” Now when a clergyman can
write like that in a publication that goes almost exclusively
among the educated classes, you can realise how
great is the difficulty which is confronting modern
thought with regard to the personality of Jesus and the
larger revelation of the Christ.</p>

<p>It is not possible that questions like this can remain
always unanswered, that they should ever be asked and
no reply be found; Christendom inevitably must work its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
way to some reasonable solution, and find how in that
marvellous personality there was a divine revelation as
men have hoped and believed, and how there is an
answer, although orthodoxy as yet may not be prepared
to give it. And if you pass from religion proper, as we
may say, to the great domain of morals which is so
closely bound up with it, see how difficult is the position
at the present time. Now, since I was last here in London,
you have had a Moral Education Congress, to which no
less than twenty-two of the European Governments sent
their best representatives. Intense interest was felt in the
question of education as part of religion or apart from it.
It is one of the most serious social questions of the day,
one which society must answer: Shall morals be based
on religion and sanctioned by religion, or can they find
standing ground apart from, separate from it? Now, the
ordinary popular answer of the day is rather in favour of
the second—that morals should find an independent
ground apart from the sanction of religion. And that is
not unnatural, because the quarrels of religious bodies,
their disputes over the question of education, have
practically wearied the mind of England, and men and
women get impatient with the struggles over trivialities
where the moral training of tens of thousands of boys
and girls, the future citizens of the country, is concerned.
If you take that Moral Education Congress, the point
was put very strongly and very plainly. Here, again, in
this number of the <cite>Hibbert</cite> that I am dealing with, we
find a very brief article speaking of that and of the relation
of education to religion; and the writer speaks of
one remarkable speech at the Education Congress, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
which it was declared that while children should be
taught “the respect due to the idea of religion …
they are to be taught that the chief mode of honouring
God consists in each doing his duty according to his
conscience and his reason.” Now that is a statement
that would find very wide acceptance at the present day,
and yet its value or its lack of value depends on two
words, “conscience” and “reason.” If the conscience
be unenlightened, there will be very little useful service
done to man by the boys and girls who follow that conscience
as men and women. The enlightened conscience
is truly the foundation of a State, but the unenlightened
may lead men into every kind of crime. The inquisitor
followed his conscience when he racked the heretic and
sent him to the stake. Laud followed his conscience
when he persecuted, tortured, mutilated Puritans who
would not bow before him. Conscience has committed
the greatest crimes against nations and against individuals;
conscience must be enlightened before it is a safe
guide. And so also with reason. If the reason is developed,
illuminated, cultured, trained, that reason might
indeed, be followed along the path of life; but a reason
that is not exercised according to the laws of logic and
right thinking may be as irrational as though the name of
reason were not applied to it. It is not enough to teach
that men should follow conscience and reason unless you
train the reason and illuminate the conscience.</p>

<p>Now, how is that to be done? It has been done in
the past by religion to a very great extent. Can society
afford to try to teach morals apart from religion? Difficulties
naturally arise here, and the Bishop of Tasmania<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
has very bravely drawn the attention of the empire to
the difficulty which is in the face of religious teaching.
He points out that the Old Testament is not a book
which, as a whole, can be used for the instruction in
morals of the Christian child. Can the Old Testament,
he asks, be used in that way? and the answer is in the
negative. He points out that you can find in the Old
Testament magnificent moral passages and splendid
moral inspiration, but that is by a process of selection, in
which you apply the moral conscience to discrimination
in ancient writings. Bishop as he is, he is brave enough
to declare that the Old Testament as a whole ought not
to find its place in the education of the child. Now,
suppose that we admit—and most thoughtful people
would admit—that you must select and choose carefully,
that is not a sufficient answer to the question. Can you
effectively teach the child morals without falling back
upon religion? Are you prepared to admit that you can
teach a certain class of virtues without religious sanction;
not those which are the favourite virtues, we may
say, of the present day of competition and of struggle?
You can teach a child to be prudent, thrifty, cautious;
you can teach him the value of acquisitiveness, and the
duty of providing for the future. All that kind of virtue
you may be able to teach on a purely utilitarian ground,
as it is called, but, as is again pointed out in a remarkably
able article on “The Social Conscience of the
Future,” certain old-fashioned traits, once considered to
be virtues, are now commonly accounted to men for
vices. Non-resistance, for example, “is now considered
cowardice; meekness to-day is usually spelt weakness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
taking no thought for the morrow is known as improvidence;
unworldliness is generally viewed as a phase of
sentimentality.” That is all quite true. But how are
you going to teach the virtues that hitherto have been
rooted in religion—virtues without which no State can
endure? For you cannot teach the civic virtues on a
basis of enlightened selfishness. That is a point that all
educators of the young must remember. Self-sacrifice,
compassion, the willingness to endure for the sake of
others, the taking of the burden of the weak on the
shoulders that are strong, the realisation that duty is
greater than rights, and responsibility more vital than
self-protection—how are you going to teach those virtues
on the basis of selfishness? Now I have argued that in
the old days, and have tried to show, in the time when I
was a sceptic, that you might train people to self-sacrifice
and self-surrender by an appeal to the humanity within
them, and the sense of duty to the race; but that appeal
fails the most readily in the cases where the virtues are
most required.</p>

<p>It appeals to the noble, but the majority are not
noble; it appeals to the unselfish and the heroic, but the
majority are of mediocre courage and of very limited
unselfishness; it appeals to those who do not need it,
and it leaves cold and unmoved those who need it most.
Will you go to the millionaire who has built up his vast
fortune by the ruin of hundreds of families, and speak to
him of the beauty of self-sacrifice and the splendour of
self-surrender? The answer of people of the selfish type
is: Why should I sacrifice myself for the future? or,
as the witty Frenchman put it: “What has posterity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
done for me that I should sacrifice myself for posterity?”
You may say that is very mean, very selfish. It is; but
then, those are the people who want the compulsory
force of moral strength applied to them. Where are
you going to find it? For without self-sacrifice no
society is secure; without self-surrender of the small to
the great, of the individual to the social self, there is
no possibility of national life, no stability in the social
system; and those are virtues that grow out of religion,
not out of what is falsely called utility. The greatest
utility for the nation is that which understands the
relationship between the part and the whole, and that is
only taught by religion which knows the larger Self,
which knits man to the whole, makes him realise relationships,
makes him know he is not a creature of one little
globe, but a creature of the universe; that he is a cosmic
life, and not a planetary. That is learned by religion
only, and by the deathless immortality of the divine Spirit
in man; without that, no morality will endure; and you
will make a fatal blunder if, because of the passing follies
of religionists, you throw religion out of its place in
education, of which it is the inspiration and the strength.</p>

<p>These are some of the problems you have to deal with
in this deadlock, as I have called it, of religion. In fact,
you want a new religious and moral synthesis; and
you cannot find that without the higher inspiration for
which man is groping now.</p>

<h4>II.—<span class="smcap">Science.</span></h4>

<p>Let us leave that deadlock—(I will try to solve it in
another lecture)—and let us take the deadlock in science.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Now that is very curious at the present time. Science
is essentially in the West, as it is everywhere, a matter of
observation, of measurement, of estimating quantities and
understanding relations. But our science is coming to the
end of its powers along these lines in a very curious and
marked way. It cannot get its apparatus more delicate
than it has got it; its balances are marvels, measuring
inappreciable parts of an almost inappreciable grain.
Nothing more exquisite than the delicacy of scientific
apparatus, nothing more a testimony to the accuracy of
the scientific mind. And yet how the apparatus is failing
the scientist! how his observations are becoming
increasingly difficult! What can he do with the atom?
The chemist, the physicist, can he follow the atom and
make that still a matter of observation, or does it wholly
escape him? is the chemist, the physicist, now obliged
to turn to the mathematician to make for him an atom
which will answer the demands of the science which is
unable to discover it for itself? All the later arguments
on the atom, if you notice, are based on mathematical
formulæ; they cannot observe; it is too fine, delicate,
minute—it escapes them. Even the chemical atom,
which is four degrees below the ultimate physical atom,
is a matter on which they are compelled to reason because
they cannot observe. But a science which reasons
without those reasons being based on observations
is no science as the West has known it up to the present
time. All scientific reasoning is supposed to be based
on observation; and if, instead of that, scientists have
to fall back on reason where observation fails them,
then a new method must be discovered, and new ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
must be trodden. I do not say there is no new method;
I do not say there are not new ways; but they are not
the methods and the ways of the science of our own
time. And there comes in this difficulty: the minute is
escaping science by its minuteness, the subtle is too subtle
for its investigation. If that be true—and it is true of
chemistry and physics, and true also to a very great
extent of electricity—we find that all the sciences are
coming up to the borderland in which their methods fail
them, and their senses no longer answer to the delicacy
of the waves that beat upon them from the outer world.
They are leaving behind them the gross and the dense;
that is conquered, it is theirs; the subtle and the rare,
those escape them; and the instruments of brass, of
glass, nay, even of sensitive needles, they are not fine
enough nor subtle enough to carry investigation further.</p>

<p>In other realms of science the same difficulties are
arriving. Psychology—where have all the facts of the
new psychology come from? From scientific men? Not a
bit of it! From frauds and charlatans, from mesmerists
and spiritualists and theosophists, and all these “ists”
that popular science looks down upon and says are
entirely outside the pale of scientific respect. And yet
from these they gather their facts, from these they are
obliged to take the strange new psychological facts that
are revolutionising all the ideas of consciousness and
the powers which lie hidden in the human mind. Those
facts are accumulating from the hands of all these improper
people, and when science gets them it cannot
explain them. It can only rearrange them and rename
them, and call mesmerism “hypnotism,” and clairvoyance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
“autoscopy.” But all that relabelling and all that rearranging
cannot veil the fundamental fact that it has no
theory into which these facts can fit, and no explanation
which arranges them in a rational order. In psychology, as
in chemistry, physics, and electricity, there is a deadlock.</p>

<p>And medicine, what about that? Doctors are beginning
to think less and less of drugs. In my young days
an honest doctor once told me that he sometimes gave
coloured water and bread pills to people whom he knew
would get on much better if they did not have drugs, but
they were so determined to have them that he was
obliged to give them something so he gave them harmless
things. That idea has grown. Doctors have less
and less faith in drugs, and they admit more and more
widely that their medical science is very largely a hand-to-mouth
thing, empirical, based on no true theory—experimental,
as they say. But, in despair of finding the
right road to health, they have gone down the terrible
byway of Vivisection, trying to wring from Nature, by
the torture of her more helpless children, the secrets
which otherwise they were unable to find. But that is
a fatal road; it is leading medicine further and further
away from any true science of healing, and is turning it
into a science of poisoning instead; medicine is becoming
a matter of balancing one poison against another, so
that in the middle of the balanced poisons you may be
able to get some miserable remnant of health. When
doctors find something they do not understand, they say:
“Oh, let us try it on an animal; better try it on an
animal than a man.” Yes; but if the animal does not
give the same result, and if that which is poison to man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
is not poison to the animal, then the results of your experiment
may be a widespread, unintentional poisoning
added to the intentional poisonings of the day. There
comes in one danger, that perhaps may make people
rather less ready to take the results of vivisection. Take
henbane: goats feed quite comfortably on henbane; it
would kill you. If, when people wanted to know the
effects of henbane on the human system, they tried it on
goats, many human deaths would have followed on the
result of that particular use of the experimental method.
What is being done with all these miserable results of
this mistaken and blinded science, all these serums and
toxins, and all the rest of the things which they are now
pouring into the human body? They are lowering the
vitality of the race; they are diminishing the disease-resisting
power of the man. I do not say that you
cannot make a man immune for a time by slowly poisoning
him, so that when a dose of the poison comes it will
have no effect. You can do it with arsenic; you can put
so much arsenic into a human body that the arsenic-poisoned
person can take a dose of arsenic without
death. Do you tell me that is health? I say it is
disease, and that all these miserable methods are lowering
the vitality of the human body, and making it a prey
to innumerable diseases under the pretence of saving it
from a few. Health is not got by poisonings, however
carefully graduated. Health is brought about by pure
living, pure food, moral self-control, and by becoming
the master and not the slave of your appetites and
passions. It is a road that leads to death, and not to
life, when you want to live evilly, and be cured of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
results of evil living out of the things which are wrung
from the tortured bodies of the animal kingdom. And so
there again there is a deadlock, for even the vivisectionists
are beginning to be a little afraid of the results that
they have drawn from their investigations. There are
answers to the problems of disease, but they do not lie
along this line.</p>

<h4>III.—<span class="smcap">Art.</span></h4>

<p>What of art? Now, very many people, I am afraid, in
this and other countries, do not realise that beauty is a
necessity of daily life for the human being, and when he
does not get it he is less man, less woman, than he ought
to be. It is not a question as to whether you should
have a beautiful thing as a luxury; it is a necessity, and
it should be the daily bread of life. Nations which knew
the value of beauty made their towns beautiful; their
works of art were made common property, their buildings
were exquisitely proportioned, their architecture
magnificent, and out of all that, open always to the
masses of the people, grew a beauty of form and a beauty
of mind that cannot possibly grow up in a nation where
the towns are allowed to be hideous, where the air is
poisoned, and where all the common things of life are
ugly instead of beautiful. There is one thing in India
that I have often complained of; it will not strike you
here so much as it would inevitably strike you there.
The old Indian life was a life full of beauty. Even now,
out in the villages, life is beautiful. The garments of
men and women alike are graceful, flowing, exquisite in
colour. If you see an Indian peasant woman working in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the fields she is a picture to paint, for the grace of her
drapery, for the beauty of the colours that she wears;
and if you see her going to the village well to draw water,
she will carry on her head some vessel, it may be of
beaten bronze or copper, it may be of kneaded clay, it
will always be beautiful in form and exquisite in colour,
Nowadays, since our civilisation has spread its power
through India, things are changing; aniline dyes are
replacing vegetable dyes; kerosene oil tins are replacing
the exquisite vessels of the older days. In the old days
in a village, when there was a wedding, every house
contributed some of its beautiful vessels for the village
festival; but now those have been cast aside, and miserable
tin vessels take their place. It is only a small
thing, you may say; I assure you it is a very great thing;
for to kill out the sense of beauty which comes by living
in contact with Nature—for Nature is beautiful everywhere,
and contact with her beautifies the human face
and form and mind—the killing-out of that sense of
beauty which grows out of the mountains and the rivers,
and the meadows and the groves, that is a national loss,
and spells national decay. The garden cities you are
beginning to build, those are not mere fancies of fanciful
people, but a wise attempt to get the people out of the
hideousness of bricks and mortar as they are used in
England, into the country, where life still is fair, and
where sunshine and colour are supreme. The life is
poor where there is no beauty, and life itself grows
common, vulgar, where beauty is not a dominating force.
It is one of the great revelations of God Himself, for
beauty lies in perfection of harmony, in exquisiteness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
outline, in loveliness of colour, and all those things are
characteristics of the Divine Workman, whose manifestation
is always in beauty, while wisdom and power
underlie it. You may see it in your own works of art.
They are not creative but imitative, and that is the sign
that art along that line has reached its ending and must
find a new inspiration. Sometimes people say you
cannot improve upon Nature; but you can show them
what there is in Nature which the blinded eyes of
ordinary people do not see. Take a flower: true, the
flower is beautiful; a little nature-spirit made it, and
caught as much of the divine thought of beauty as that
small intelligence was able to conceive; do you tell me
that when the artist comes the divine life is not far more
largely evolved in him than in that little nature-spirit,
that he cannot catch more of God’s thought in the flower
than the nature-spirit was able to express? And that is
what the great painter, poet, musician does; he hears
and sees and tells the thoughts of God more fully than
you and I can do with our dull ears and our limited
vision and our clumsy tongues. It is there, but we
cannot see it. The artist is the revealer of the divine
beauty in form, and unless he can do that he is no true
artist at all. The artist has yet to come to this civilisation—the
man who can see through the forms of the
present the divine idea which is striving to express itself
in new ideals, new hopes, new powers. These are
wanted for art, and these shall come in the days that are
dawning; and a new art shall be found in the new
heavens and the new earth.</p>

<p>So, although I have taken you to-day along a dreary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
path—for I have been speaking of the passing, and not
the coming—it is because I want you to realise in the
signs of the world around you that you are in the midst
of a closing age; not only that you may know it—that
is little—but that out of the knowledge of the closing
you may prepare for the race which is to be born. For
unless you understand, you cannot guide your steps
aright; unless you understand, the world will be a mere
puzzle, and not an expression of the divine thought. The
age that is closing has done its work, has trained the
concrete mind, has trained the scientific thought, has
developed power and strength and energy—all good gifts
of God, to be used for nobler purposes than they are used
for to-day. There is nothing to regret, nothing to be
sorry for, nothing to wish otherwise in the world that is
dying. It has done its work; but it is ours to come out
of the dying world into a world that is new, and it is out
of the dying into the coming world that I would fain try
to lead your thoughts, and perhaps your lives as well.</p>

<h3 id="I_Lecture_II">Lecture II<br />
<span class="smaller">The Deadlock in Social Conditions:
Luxury and Want Face to Face</span></h3>

<p>Friends: I am to speak to you to-night on a subject
which is a little outside our ordinary theosophical lectures.
The Theosophist, as a rule, studies and talks
about causes more than effects, concerning himself more
with the getting rid of the causes of misery than with
the effects that grow out of those causes and show themselves
as particular forms of misery. Because of that
he is sometimes called unpractical. But that is a misuse
of words; for to understand the causes of misery
and to remove them is far more practical than cutting
off the tops of the weeds while you allow the roots to
remain underground to reproduce new weeds to-morrow.
To say that study with the discussion which grows out of
it is unpractical is very much as though you declared that
it was a practical thing to send out nurses and doctors
to a field of battle to cut off limbs that had been shattered
and to nurse the cripples back to health, and denied
that to try to remove the causes of war was practical.
Now, I admit that sending out nurses and doctors
is a practical thing, but I allege that to work for
the substitution of arbitration for war is a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
more practical. So with the particular things with
which I am to deal to-night. I am dealing with effects,
but only with a view to lead you on to the study of
causes, and to the fundamental changes that will have to
be made in the building up of a greater and nobler civilisation.
Part of the way to turn men’s minds in that
direction, and to give them the necessary impulse of
working for the higher and the greater, is to show them
the intolerable nature of conditions among which we are
living to-day. In doing that, I am by no means going
astray from the teaching and the example of that great
and misunderstood woman to whom I owe all that is
happiest and best in my life, H. P. Blavatsky. Some of
you who are students of Theosophy may remember that
in her <cite>Key to Theosophy</cite> she speaks about the misery of
the East End of London, and utters words of praise for
the attempts which were being made to change it. She
did a good deal more than speak words of praise; for
one day, after I had been telling her of some of the
piteous sights that I was seeing day by day as member
of the London School Board, as it was then, for the
East End of London, I had on the following morning a
little characteristic note, in which she enclosed a couple
of sovereigns, saying: “You know I am only a pauper,
but give these to the little children who asked you
yesterday for a flower.” Similarly, that quick sympathy
with human suffering came out in an instance in which
very few of us, perhaps, would be prepared to follow her
example. She was going to America, and only had just
money enough to buy her ticket across; she bought it,
and on the wharf she saw a crying woman with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
little children. She asked why they were distressed, and
the woman told how she had bought bogus tickets from
some scamp, and so could not go across the ocean to
join her husband. H. P. B. walked back to the ticket
office, got her first-class ticket changed for steerage
tickets for herself and that unfortunate woman and
children, and passed the voyage in the steerage part of
an Atlantic liner—a very practical proof of the brotherhood
which she proclaimed. So that, after all, I am not
really going very far apart in taking up this particular
subject of human misery and human suffering, showing
you, what I dare say you know well enough, some of the
cases which should stimulate to action. And if you say
to me: It is an old story that you are telling us; then my
answer to you will be that until the evils are remedied
it is necessary to repeat the story over and over again.</p>

<p>Now let us look over this great civilisation, and see
what I have called “The Deadlock in Social Conditions.”
First let us remember, as a kind of preliminary
atmosphere, that the great civilisations of the past
have perished from this startling contrast of luxury and
misery, and that what has happened over and over again
in the past might quite well repeat itself amongst us to-day.
For we are no stronger in our civilisation than
were the civilisations of Rome, of Assyria, of Egypt;
and we find in the Egyptian civilisation just the same sort
of questions arising then as arise now, as though the
world really had not progressed in this respect. In some
of the unburied tablets and sculptures we find an edict
about the wages of the workpeople, and how they were
to be told not to be discontented, and not to refuse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
work because they were dissatisfied with the amount of
wage that they obtained; and in another case we find
directions being sent in order to meet the difficulties
that had been caused by what we in our own time should
call a strike of working people. The difficulties are very
old, and the world has not yet solved them. It is in the
hope that the coming civilisation will solve them that
I am drawing your attention again to them to-night.
Now even here we have what we call our submerged
classes, and those form one-tenth part of the population—a
terrible proportion if you come to think of
it. Sometimes, when there has been a mutiny in an
army, a regiment is drawn up rank after rank, and
every tenth man is marked out to be shot while the
others go free. That is the condition of our civilisation
now—every tenth person is marked out to misery. In
India the proportion is even larger. The submerged
classes there amount to one-sixth of the population,
but, on the other hand, they are not nearly as miserable
as are the corresponding classes here: they are
more despised, but they are far happier, partly because
the belief in which they have grown up, under the
thousands of years that lie behind them in that civilisation,
has ever been that a man’s condition in the present
is due to causes that he himself has set going in
the past. So that those people, instead of blaming their
neighbours, blame themselves for the discomfort of their
own position, and sometimes determine that their next
birth shall be a happier one by making the very best
they can of the disadvantages here. Then again, poverty
there is really not as terrible as here; you read of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
famine that sweeps away hundreds of thousands of the
people, but is that really so very much more terrible than
the continual condition of underfeeding in which our
submerged classes live? The Registrar-General does
not mark them down “Died of Starvation”—that would
be shocking the public taste; but if you look into the
matter you will see that when the starved sempstress
going home carrying her work is struck by an east wind
that whistles through her thin clothing and strikes on
her underfed body, she is put down in the report as
“Died of pneumonia, bronchitis, or consumption,” but
in karma’s record she is marked down “Died of starvation,”
for it is the perennial underfeeding that brings
about the great mortality among the poor. I need only
take a very few cases as examples in order to show you
what this poverty means. I have taken them out of casual
papers during the last week: from my own experience
of the past I know them not to be exaggerated,
but these particular cases happen to be going on just
now. One of them is the case of the women who sew
on cards the hooks and eyes which we buy very cheaply
in the shops. Such a woman sews nearly 47,000 hooks
and eyes for 1s. 2½d.—a thousand almost per farthing.
Think what it means. Naturally she pulls in her children
to help her; and so the children, who are obliged to go
to school, for we have compulsory education, when they
come back from learning their lessons have to sit down
and set to work linking the hooks and the eyes together
so as to save a little of the mother’s time, and the
children, who ought to be playing and building up strong
and healthy bodies, are kept there hour after hour preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the hooks and eyes for which the mother is to
receive the princely payment that I have mentioned.
Take another case that everybody knows—shirt-making:
1s. a dozen for men’s shirts, and there is a fair amount
of work in those; even that is not the lowest depth,
for the woman who takes them out to make at 1s. per
dozen lets them out again at 8d. per dozen to a woman
more miserable than herself. And so the thing goes on,
home after home, person after person. This and the
preceding case I am taking from the last issue of <cite>The
Christian Commonwealth</cite>. Another case is mentioned
there of a woman who had been working along these
lines; her particular work, I think, was 5d. per dozen
for collars, and find your own thread. She was brought
up as a typical case before the Royal Commission. We
are always ready to appoint Royal Commissions, but not
very much comes out of them after they have taken
evidence. She was asked by a Member of Parliament:
“How do you and your children live on what you get in
this way?” “We don’t live,” was the answer of the
woman, and she spoke truly. She worked sometimes
twenty hours a day, from six o’clock in the morning till
two o’clock next morning, in order to get enough to feed
her children and herself. I could go on for hours giving
you cases like this, but I only want typical ones, in
order that you may realise the conditions in which so
many are living while we are comfortable and at ease.</p>

<p>Pass on from that part of this terrible poverty which
nothing apparently is able to touch to the next question
that links itself very easily to what I have been saying—woman
labour in general, and especially in many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
manufacturing industries. When women began to work
at mills, and so on, it was looked upon as a good way for
the women to add something to the comfort of the home.
How has it worked? It has worked to drive down the
wages of the men, and make the home more miserable
even in money matters than it was before; and then the
home has ceased to be a home, for there is no home
where the mother leaves the children behind her, and
goes out into the mill to earn the pence or the shillings
wherewith those children are to be fed. It has been
encouraged for the reason that a manufacturer gave
very honestly and frankly before another Royal Commission.
“Oh,” he said, “I prefer to employ married
women because they are more docile.” That is true. The
married woman is very much more docile because, when
the question of any resistance comes, she thinks of the
children who need food in the home. The baby hands
are the hands that make her docile; it is the baby
fingers feeling her bosom for the milk that will not come
that makes the mother’s heart docile, yielding to everything
for the sake of the little child. It has only made
the complications of the labour market worse; it has
only driven the men out to be unemployed in the streets,
while they who ought to be mothers in the home are
working in the factory instead. So the labour market
only becomes more choked, the wages are rendered yet
more miserable, and the men are thrown out while the
women are employed, though the men cannot take the
woman’s place in the home, and take care of the babies
and look after the little ones; only a mother can do that,
for nature has made mothers for that work, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
father cannot take their place, however gentle and loving
he may be. So you get another problem there, hard to
solve, difficult to set right, and one that is ever growing
more and more pressing for solution, that is ever intensifying
the misery of large numbers of the working
population.</p>

<p>Pass on, again, from that—you see I am only touching
each point—and take a question of national import, the
deterioration of the physique of the people who live in
our large cities. That has been going on now for generations,
and it has been shown very plainly in the
lowering standard of height for enlistment in the Army.
On the other hand, if you look at the well-to-do classes
you will find rather an increase in strength and physique
amongst them, especially amongst the women, because
these take so much more part in outdoor life than they
did in the past, and so you find they are growing taller
and stronger, but the great mass of the population is
growing shorter and weaker. But it is that great mass
of the population from which the majority of your nation
comes. They reproduce most rapidly; they are the
people who swell the Registrar-General’s returns; from
them the future nation is most largely produced; and it
is no good to have upper classes strong and vigorous and
well-fed if the mass of your population is deteriorating
in strength and vigour. There, again, you have one of
these pressing problems which it is necessary to answer;
for these problems are like the questions of the Sphinx:
the Sphinx put the question, and if the man could not
answer it, the Sphinx devoured him. And so with these
problems in social organisation; the question is put, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the penalty for not answering is to be devoured, and for
the civilisation to pass away.</p>

<p>Remedies of sorts are being put forward by doctors
and sociologists; sterilisation of the unfit is one of the
favourite nostrums or quack remedies of the day. But
such remedies are worse than the disease, for they are
brutal, and lead to deterioration of <i lang="fr">morale</i> as well as of
physique. You must go down to the root of the causes
that make these the unfit, and not bring them forth
from the social organisation by the myriad, and then try
to find means to check their numbers; and so on that
side, again, this insoluble difficulty is facing us.</p>

<p>Even these are not all the problems which are set for
us by our Sphinx for which solution is demanded. We
have seen terrible poverty, we have seen the question of
woman employment, we have seen the question of deterioration
of physique and swift multiplication of the
unfit: what about the criminal population? We manufacture
habitual criminals at a very rapid rate. We take
up young men or young women, and we send them to
jail for a week, a month, a year, five years, ten years.
It goes on accumulating until the habitual offender gets
sentences which will outlast his physical life. But that
has done nothing to cure the man, that has done nothing
to turn him into a good and useful citizen. The law,
when it grips him, ought to turn him into a better type
of man. Instead of that, he comes back over and over
again, until the very habitual criminality that the law has
very largely made is brought up as a reason for the
magistrate to inflict upon him a heavier penalty. But
that is not wisdom; it is folly. Very often a bright, clever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
lad, full of spirit, falls into crime. It is only one chance
in a hundred if he is rescued, and does not gradually
drift into the ranks of the habitual criminal. Surely at
this stage of civilisation there must be some better way;
and there is a better way, as I shall try to show you when
I come to deal with brotherhood applied to social life.</p>

<p>If we go beyond these extreme cases, and look at the
ordinary questions of supply and demand, of production
and distribution, notice how society is gradually coming
to a point where things cannot go on as they are, and
yet where to change them means the dislocation of our
whole productive and distributive system. We can see
it best, perhaps, if we go to America, because in America
there are not the softening influences which to some
extent at least still prevail here, where society was once
based on a more human foundation, instead of merely on
the question of cash. We see what our systems are if
we go over the water to America, where they have full
play, without anything to prevent their complete development.
There are one or two things that strike us in
America of a rather remarkable character. First, the
growth of the man who builds his own enormous fortune
on the deliberate wrecking of the small fortunes of others.
Let me give an example. A large number of people,
mostly rather poor, gather together into a company in
order to build a railway that is wanted for the development
of the country where they are. They want quicker
communication, they want better carriage of grain, of
goods, and they build a railway. It is working fairly
well, it is paying, perhaps not very largely, but still fairly
satisfactorily. A much cleverer man than those people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
comes along, and he sees that that particular district is
one that is likely to open up to a very large extent—one
where railways will become most valuable property.
He sets to work to build another railway that runs over
the same ground as the first; it is not wanted except to
make him rich. He then begins to destroy the other
railway by charging smaller fares and lower freightage;
he goes on doing that, putting in his capital, because his
rates do not pay, until the other railway is driven down
to the impossible level at which he has fixed prices and
fares: when the shares of that other railway have sunk
down to nearly nothing in the market, he steps in and
buys them all up; when he has bought them all up he
lets his sham railway go to pieces, and the whole of the
district is in his hands, and he piles up an enormous
fortune. On the other side of his fortune is the loss to
all the shareholders who put their money into that
railway in order to improve the means of communication
in the place where they were living. They have been
sacrificed that he might make enormous wealth. Such
men are called “wreckers” in America, but they are
honoured in society; they build hospitals, and even
churches; they do all kinds of things with fragments of
the wealth that they have taken; but I tell you that,
although not by the law of the country, yet by the law of
righteousness, these men are worse and more to be condemned
than the burglar who steals the jewels of a lady
or the gold plate of a millionaire. He is punished heavily
when he is caught, and he deserves to be punished;
burglary is obviously wrong; but worse than that open
burglary that the law punishes is the hidden burglary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the brilliant brain against the stupid brain, which robs
people of the result of their labour in order to accumulate
it within the wrecker’s store.</p>

<p>Other forms of this robbery are what are called
“trusts” and “corners.” They have been trying, I see,
to make a corner in wheat, and another speculator has
been able to checkmate the original speculator by pouring
in millions of bushels of wheat. But people are
not fed any better whichever speculator wins; it is
only a problem as to which of the two should be able to
make the largest profits; and then the trusts are built
up, whereby a few men are able to make enormous
fortunes and kill out all the smaller men. Now our
American brethren are getting a little tired of that, and
they are trying to find out some way in which they can
prevent it—some Act of Congress, some law which
should prevent the trust. But what law can you possibly
pass to prevent the trust, which is only the natural
outcome of competition gone mad? What can you do
to prevent that without crippling also every one of your
industrial concerns which are based on the same principle
of cut-throat competition? There is where the
deadlock comes in again. The whole thing is built up
on one man fighting against another, one man trying to
overreach another, one man trying to make better bargains
for himself, no matter what happens to his neighbour—that
is the whole method of what we call our
commercial system. If that be so, how are you going to
interfere with its natural outcome, with the inevitable
result which grows out of it?—the same principle, only
carried a little to excess, and so shocking the conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that was not shocked when people were ruined piecemeal,
but is shocked when they are ruined by hundreds
and by thousands; yet each one of those who were
ruined piecemeal suffered as much, his lot was as unfortunate.
How, then, can you cripple the excess without
undermining the whole? There is another of the problems
which are set, and yet in the very midst of it there
is a gleam of a brighter future, for in that great alchemy
with which the mighty Chemist of the world’s laboratory
changes the forces that destroy into forces that construct,
there are signs that these trusts which have
grown out of the greed and selfishness of men will
really be organisations of industry which will be useful
to the community in the future, when Brotherhood has
replaced competition, and when thought for others takes
the place of only thinking for oneself. And so we see
possibilities even in the midst of the troubles.</p>

<p>Let us glance at another side of this problem—the
attempts which are being made to improve social conditions
in newer countries, as they are called, say, Australia.
In Australia the working classes have got everything
that they are asking for here; it is called the working-man’s
paradise. Every boy of twenty-one can vote; think
of the magnificent freedom of it! Every girl of twenty-one
can vote; what more would you have? No need of
agitation there. But, unluckily, the boys care much more
about football than they do about questions in Parliament,
and the girls, perhaps, are thinking more of bonnets
and hats than of the way in which their votes ought
to be cast. They have all got the vote and they do not
know what to do with it, and that is a very common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
thing. It does not occur only in Australia. Has it ever
struck you that you are paying in happiness for what you
call liberty, if you mean by liberty the right to cast a
vote? No matter what your qualifications, that is quite
outside the question; no matter whether you know anything
about the questions, that is not of the least importance;
no matter if your head is as empty as ever it can
be, it counts just as much at the polling-booth as the
head of the wisest statesman, thinker, most highly
trained economist or historian. It is an admirable way of
governing when you come to look at it from the outside
standpoint. Let us see how it works in Australia where
they have it: you have not got it yet; you are on the
way to it. All these people have votes, and the great
majority, as is always the case, are ignorant. There has
been class legislation over here, and they have class
legislation over there—it is not a good thing, only there
it is just the other way up; and the effect of ignorant
class legislation is even worse than the effect of educated
class legislation. Let us see how it works. First, it
works for a gradual diminution of efficiency along the
ordinary lines of work, on which, remember, the whole
prosperity of the country depends. The boy who is a
free man does not care to be an apprentice, and it does
not to do tell the boy he has done his work badly, because
he is a free Australian, and off he goes, and he won’t
work any more if you tell him he has not worked well.
But, you know, nature is a very awkward thing to come
striking up against in your political and social life, and
her laws do not get modified as you might think they
should. The boy who won’t learn becomes the workman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
who is wanting in skill, and so the level of efficiency in
production is getting lower and lower. If they want
a piece of good machinery they have to send over here
to get it—although there is a very heavy price put upon
importing it into Australia—because the work there is so
badly done that the machines won’t work properly after
they are made, and that is one of the results that we
are seeing at the present time. Another one is, that unemployment
is increasing. There are men in the streets
there just as there are here, clamouring for work, and
asking the Government to give it to them; and how
do they get there? Very many of them because they
must not work under a certain wage, which is not a
possible wage to pay for the kind of work that they can
do. Suppose you happen to have a little garden; you
want to have your paths weeded and your grass cut.
That is gardener’s work. Now a gardener must not work
under 10s. a day, and your poor professional man who is
at a discount in the matter of votes, and has a fixed
income, cannot afford to pay 10s. a day to have his paths
weeded, so he goes to weed them himself, and the would-be
gardener goes out, and is unemployed in the streets,
and calls on the Government to find him work. There
is a very serious side to that beyond the question of unemployment.
If you are going to make the men who
should give better work to the country than the weeding
of paths weed their own paths for themselves, then you
are putting a check on the whole of the higher kinds of
labour on which the nobler national life depends, for it
is as true now as it ever was that man does not live by
bread alone. If you are going to make every man do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
manual labour, you can get nothing more than the kind
of paradise that you find in “Looking Backward,” which
is more a paradise for the respectable suburb than for a
nation that needs art and beauty, music and literature.
Those things want leisure to produce and time to perfect.
There must be education behind them before
they can be produced, and it is a very bad arrangement
to press all your nation down to a low level of comfortable
eating and drinking and amusement, and forget the
mightier things that make a national life—the products
of genius, the creative exertions of thought. There is
one of the greater dangers. You cannot blame the
poor people. ‘As long as a man is hungry, a good meal
is the one thing he wants, and that must be his ideal.
But nations ought not to be built up on the crude ideas
of the ignorant and the hungry. That is the duty of
wisdom. But see how difficult this question becomes;
see how it is even in this country, where still education
is a very great weight in popular affairs, even though
the vote ignores it. A man may know his own trade, and
be able to give very good counsel and advice as to what
is necessary for that one particular trade in which he is
working; but a nation is not made up of one trade; it is
made up of a hundred different occupations, every one
interlinked and interrelated with all the others, and you
cannot legislate nationally by simply looking at a single
occupation or a single class. You must see how your
law reacts on the whole of the complicated organism;
otherwise you ruin your nation while you lift up a single
trade, and that is what is happening in Australia.
Certainly some of the trades are very well provided and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
arranged for, but the rest of the elements that ought to
make a nation are disregarded, and life for them is made
impossible; and even within the limits of a trade, sometimes
things are marvellously stupid. Let me give you
one example. Melbourne is a large city, and occasionally
it has very hot weather. The trades unions there have
made a law that milk shall not be delivered more than
once a day on Sunday; the poor man wants his holiday,
and it is very selfish of you if you want to make him
work on Sunday, so that milk may only be delivered in
the morning. Now the difficulty is that the cows have not
yet come into the trades unions; they do not realise that
on Sunday they are only to give milk once a day and not
twice. Without the slightest regard for the beauty of
social arrangements, they wilfully persist in giving milk
in the afternoon as well as in the morning. But the unfortunate
milkman must not sell it, because if he did he
would be turned out of his trade union, and that would
mean destruction. So he has to keep it; and if the
weather is hot it is not quite so good in the morning, in
spite of the boracic acid, as it was the night before. So
he mixes up the fresh milk of the morning and the stale
milk of the night before, and sells it all as fresh milk:
and though you may not discover it in the milk-can,
the baby discovers it in the milk-bottle, and the death-rate
of the children goes up in the summer because of
this admirable arrangement which has been made with
regard to the distribution of milk. That is not the way
that nations can really be governed; and there are all
sorts of restrictions of that kind which constantly come
up against you in the home, and make you feel that life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
is not in any sense free. Things of this sort can only
succeed if certain conditions are willingly accepted by all
the people who have to work under them, and not when
they are imposed for the benefit of a particular trade
or an unwilling and reluctant population.</p>

<p>Let us go one step further; we need not go out to
Australia now. We have to replace competition by co-operation.
You may say that is being very largely done.
Certainly very much has been done in co-operative distribution;
Lancashire and Yorkshire are full of successful
co-operative works. How many are there of co-operative
productive works? The idea has been tried a good
many times, but it has always broken down for two reasons:
first, that in production you want one clear, strong
brain which is a despot over the production; you cannot
do it by boards and committees and popular votes, and all
the rest of it, because in that commercial production there
are many things to think of; very swift changes may
come about, and the one able man is able to seize the
right moment and to lead his affair to success, where divided
councils and delay and discussion spell bankruptcy.
That is one of the difficulties with regard to this production.
There is something still more serious—the want
of trust. The people don’t trust each other; they are
suspicious of each other. They suspect each other of
personal ends, instead of honestly co-operating for the
public good. So they change their officers continually, and
there is no continuity of policy. That fault of want of
trust, want of confidence, imputation of bad motives, is
fatal and must remain fatal until people can grow out of
it into Brotherhood. At the present time, when one man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
born among the working classes, as they are called, by
ability and skill, eloquence and application, rises into the
higher social ranks, his bitterest opponents are to be
found in the class which he has quitted; and when he
finds, as he must find—because again he strikes up
against great natural laws—when he finds that Trafalgar
Square remedies are not workable when you come to
put them within the four corners of an Act of Parliament,
then people call him traitor, deserter, renegade,
and the best he can do will not win him trust and confidence.
How is that to be dealt with?</p>

<p>Oh, you say, you will have to change human nature
before your plans will work. Exactly; that is precisely
what has to be done. Do you think it is impossible?
Human nature is changing every day; human nature is
continually in a state of flux. The human nature of the
Middle Ages is not the same as the human nature of our
own time. When knight-errants went plunging about,
fighting and the rest of it, it might very well have been
said: “Oh, you have to change human nature before you
can get people to sit quietly down and submit to the law,
instead of knocking their oppressor on the head.” Quite
true; but human nature has been changing through those
centuries, so that instead of riding out to right your own
wrong, you call in the nearest policeman and submit it to
the arbitration of the law. Why should not human nature
go on changing? As a matter of fact it is changing before
our eyes, and the changes that are coming in it are the
unfolding of the divine Spirit in man; the outer forms
change to embody the unfolding Spirit, and the lower human
nature is always changing, and gradually producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
itself in higher and higher forms. In the very midst of
this struggle and competition, this misery and conflict,
you can see, if you will open your eyes, the germs of a
nobler, higher, more brotherly civilisation. How different
is the social conscience from what it was even a century
ago; how different the common feeling of responsibility
when wrong things are done and misery is left unalleviated!
How many more of the classes that are called
comfortable cannot remain comfortable while they know
misery is outside their doors; how many are beginning to
recognise the great fact that whatever one has earned one
holds as a steward, and not as an owner, in a world
where all men are brothers, and where the duty of the
family is the duty of each! That thought is spreading
further and further, wider and wider; but the great
change must come from above, not from below. Starving,
ignorant men can make riots, sometime even revolutions;
but only wisdom and love can build up a new civilisation
that shall endure. I remember that one day, when
H. P. Blavatsky was asked: “Are you a Socialist?” her
answer was, “I believe in the Socialism that gives; I do
not believe in the Socialism that takes.” There lies the
keynote of the future. When those who have are ready
to sacrifice, then the dawning of the new era will be seen
in the sky that is over our earth; when wealth and education
and power are held as trusts for the common good,
ah! then will come the laying of the foundations of a better
and a nobler State. When the educated man and woman
remember: “This education of mine, bought by the
ignorance of thousands who have laboured in order that
I might be educated, really belongs to them, and I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
give it back to them in service, in order to pay the debt
that I have contracted to them”; when the wealthy man
feels: “I am a steward, not an owner of this wealth
which has come out of the labour of thousands; let it help
the uplifting of thousands”—then Brotherhood is beginning
to show itself upon earth. When the gentle and the
refined realise that gentleness and refinement are meant
to be shared, and not shut up away in drawing-rooms to
guard them as though they were delicate Dresden china
that must not be used for fear it should be broken—when
that day comes, we shall be nearer the beginning of
a great social change. It must be by renunciation, by
self-abnegation, that the foundations of that great
brotherly civilisation will be laid. In a family, the elders
think of the youngers; and when food is short, it is the
elders who go without it in order that the little ones may
be fed. So in every social movement the note of the
higher is renunciation, the note of the lower is love and
co-operation; then they will blend together, and each will
bring what he has to give, none will despise another, for
everything is equally necessary for the building up of a
nation. The strength of the navy, the genius of the philosopher,
the skill of the worker, the keen brain of the organiser—the
whole of these must make a common work;
and none should either despise or envy, for it is one work
which is being made by all for the good of everyone.</p>

<p>If you say to me: “That hope can but be a dream,”
my answer to you is, that as man is divine there is nothing
too great for him to imagine or too exquisite for him
to achieve. Think highly of yourselves, highly of your
divine possibilities; realise that you are Gods in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
making, and that you can build anything to which you
can aspire. Thought is the mightiest power; the
thought-image first, and then its materialisation in the
physical world. But it is not enough to think; the materialisation
here has to be made; and there are signs of
that in the great Christian civilisation which is still the
dominant power in Christendom. For men are beginning
to talk now not of heaven away beyond the clouds, but
of heaven here on earth; of the kingdom of Christ on
earth that shall surely come, not only in the ideal but in
the actual; a civilisation based on brotherhood, wisdom,
love. That is what is going to be done in the world just
now opening up before us. Men are no longer content to
be happy after death, they want to be happy on this side
of death as well; and they shall be, unless the prayer
that you who are Christians utter day by day is only a
lip worship and not a reality: “Thy will be done on earth,
even as it is done in heaven.” It is on earth the new great
civilisation is to come, that Brotherhood is to be realised,
that the nations of the future are to be built on the type
of the family, and not on a type of a struggle of wild
beasts in the jungle. That is the future to which we are
looking; and if on this Sunday and last Sunday I have
drawn the darker side, it is to show that because things
are at a deadlock, therefore He who holds the key of
every lock is near to His return on earth. In the Sundays
that lie before us I hope to work out that second
side of the subject, to show you how these things are
passing away, and how it has been declared in the higher
world, and the cry is echoing in the lower: “Behold, I
make all things new!”</p>

<h3 id="I_Lecture_III">Lecture III<br />
<span class="smaller">The New Doors Opening In
Religion, Science, and Art</span></h3>

<p>Friends: On the preceding evenings on which I have addressed
you we have had our attention turned backwards
to the past, or we were glancing at the present. We are
now to turn our eyes to the future, and, starting from
the basis of the present and of certain facts which are
already showing themselves amongst us, to consider what
new doors are opening in Religion, in Science, and in
Art; what new avenues of knowledge are beginning to
show themselves stretching to far-off horizons—horizons,
in fact, which are not really the limit of those
avenues, but only the limit to which we can at present
pierce. I am chiefly concerned to endeavour to show
you that this promise of the opening of new doors is a
great reality; that the sounds are around us; that, as it
were, the doors are already a little open, and we have the
right to think that as man evolves a little further those
doors will open wider and wider, so that the race may
pass through them to a wiser and a happier future. In
order to make this intelligible and clear, I shall have to
ask you for a few moments to consider with me a certain
view of man’s nature and constitution, a view which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
practically universal among the ancient religions of the
world, which is indicated, although not fully carried out
perhaps in detail, in the more modern faith of Christendom,
which is revived amongst us, and is being taught
all over the world by means of the Theosophical Society;
not a new view, but a very old one, clothed only in new
garments in deference to the advancing mind of man.
Now this view I must put roughly, but without that
statement the method of the opening of the new doors
would remain unintelligible. It is briefly this: That
every human being is fundamentally a spiritual intelligence,
appropriating to himself portions of matter in the
various types of worlds in which he lives; that that spiritual
intelligence commences the great world-cycle as a
germ or seed of divinity; and just as if, where you had
an ordinary seed, a grain of corn, that grain would not
grow and develop the powers within it unless it were
planted in the soil, the soil whose juices nourish it, unless
it were rained upon, and unless the sun shone upon it,
so is it with the divine germ, the human Spirit. It is
planted in the soil of human experience, whose juices
shall gradually enable it to unfold its divine possibilities.
It is watered with the rain of human tears, the tears of
sorrow and of pain; it is vivified, strengthened, enabled
to grow by the sunshine of human joy and human delight;
and out of the contact of experience, out of the
rain of sorrow and the sunshine of joy, gradually, generation
after generation, century after century, millennium
after millennium, the divine germ becomes
a divine man, perfect in the manifested powers of Deity
enfolded within him from the first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>But in order that that æonian evolution and unfolding
may go forward, it is necessary that this divine germ
should come into contact with matter. Hence veil after
veil of matter enwraps, is appropriated by, this divine
germ, and he draws around himself—as he descends
from the highest heavens down to the earth, through
region after region of ever-densifying matter—and appropriates
veil after veil, in order that by contact with
that matter, which alone can give him experience, the
powers within him may unfold and the matter that he
appropriates may become his servant, his instrument of
manifestation. So when we look at any one of ourselves
at the stage that we have reached to-day, we find a spiritual
being many of whose powers have unfolded, but
some of whose powers remain not yet unfolded into
manifestation, and we find, clothing, as it were, that unfolding
Spirit, the veils of matter of which I spoke, no
longer mere inchoate veils, but bodies more or less definitely
organised for the purposes of the unfolding life. On
our physical plane, in the world in which we are to-day,
that appropriated matter is now highly organised, and
has become the servant of the intelligence of the Spirit to
a very large extent in the more highly developed human
beings. It has had developed in it, age after age, those
organs of knowledge that we call the senses; five in number
at the present time, as mankind has passed through
five of those great Races that I likened to the waves of
the human ocean when I first addressed you on this subject.
You may remember that then I spoke of ourselves
as being in the fifth of those great waves, and also in the
fifth sub-wave, as we may say, into which the larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
wave divides itself. Even looking back along our experience
in the present cycle of human growth, we can
see these senses developing from their earliest inception
up to the present point of keenness that they have
reached, one sense developing in all its stages through
one of the great Races.</p>

<p>In order that you may not think that that is quite
removed from experience, let me ask you for a moment
to look at a fairly prominent family of the fourth race,
the one that preceded our own, which is now living in
Burma, part of the Indian empire. In that fourth race
as a whole the sense of taste was the one that was
gradually evolving, the sense of smell being only germinal
and rudimentary, not developed. Now if you go among
the Burmans to-day and inquire into their diet, you will
find that one favourite article of diet is fish; but not
fish freshly drawn from sea or river, but fish that has
been caught for some time, buried in the ground until
it has become fairly aged, and then unburied, to form
a delightful dish on the Burmese table. Certainly you
can well realise the fact that in that fourth Race people
the sense of taste is very different from what it is
amongst yourselves, with perhaps one exception that I
ought to make, that I believe even now in the sense of
taste in some people finds gratification in game and
venison that are euphemistically called “high.” Well, the
fish that the Burman eats is very high; one might almost,
if it were not rude, perhaps apply to it a word
more like calling a spade a spade, and call it rotten.
Now no one could eat such food as that and find it
pleasant if the sense of smell, which has so much to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with the more delicate savours of taste, were already
well developed among the people; and I take that as a
striking illustration, one that has come also under my
own observation, in order to make clear what I mean
when I say to you that with each race one sense is
developed and the next sense to it is only germinal, and
shows itself out in the following race, through which it
grows to higher and higher perfection. So that the
mere fact of the five senses of the present is an indication
of the point at which humanity is standing, and a
proverb—and there is often much truth in proverbs—about
a man being frightened out of his seven senses,
although at present he has only five, may serve as an
indication of the widespread and ancient tradition that
man has two races still through which he will evolve,
and senses which will be developed as those races gradually
develop upon earth; so that in the sixth Race, with
which I shall have to deal in these lectures this day fortnight,
“The Coming Race,” we shall be looking for
the development of a new sense, the sense which will
make the next world on the other side of death as palpable
to us in the physical body as the physical world
is palpable at the present time. For in man that form
of vision will be the next to develop; and as his next
higher body, the astral, becomes rightly organised, then
in the physical brain will develop <i lang="la">pari passu</i> the organ
whereby the knowledge of that world will come into the
physical consciousness, and thus enormously widen our
outlook, and make palpable what now is hidden from
the eyes of most.</p>

<p>Taking this view of man, that he is an unfolding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
spiritual consciousness, we find that he creates for himself,
as he unfolds, more highly organised bodies of matter,
so that the double growth is going on in every one
of us, higher stages of unfolding consciousness, subtler
bodies of matter by which that consciousness can express
itself clearly and definitely; to every change in consciousness
a vibration in matter answering; to every vibration
in matter a change in consciousness responding; so that
there are side by side the unfolding of the Spirit and
the development of a more delicate and more highly
organised body, the difference showing itself in the
nervous system as well as in the mere outer configuration
of the body. Glance again at that fourth Race,
study its nervous system, and you will find it very different
from your own. While like your own in outer
configuration, while the differences between the brain
and the general distribution of the nerves to the body
are not great, if you go into the question of the organisation
of that nervous system you will find that an
enormous gulf divides the fourth and the fifth great
Races of mankind. Again, if you want a proof, look at
the amount of pain or the amount of physical injury
which can be endured, say, by the Chinaman, in comparison
with what you can bear. Notice that an enormous
laceration inflicted on the body of the Chinaman
leaves him ready to recover rapidly, while a similar injury
to you would kill you by nervous shock. It is
not the question of the mutilation—that and the loss
of blood might be the same in each—but the fifth Race
man dies from nervous shock, where the fourth
Race man with the coarser nervous system is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
able to recover, is able to re-establish the nervous
equilibrium.</p>

<p>Another point you may notice among yourselves to-day,
emphasising as you do in your own Teutonic sub-race
the characteristics of the great Aryan Race to
which all these branches that are spread over the West
as well as in India belong. Looking at that, you will
find, as you come into your own Teutonic sub-race, that
nervous diseases increase; and they are increasing very
rapidly at the present time, far more rapidly apparently
than at any other period in human history. The strain
on your present nervous system is beginning to be too
great, for it is evolving a little more rapidly than the
outer world is evolving to meet it; and hence, in order
that you may not suffer from continual nervous diseases,
it is necessary to begin to refine and to purify your lives,
leaving the grosser passions behind you which in the
course of evolution you now ought to have outgrown.
As the next sub-race is born—and it is beginning at the
present time—the nervous system will become more and
more delicate, and keener sense-organs will appear in
the children in larger and larger numbers. Our present
organs of sense will first become intensified. Then, after
much intensification, the newer organs will begin to
show themselves—those which will unfold to us the
world on the other side of death. To this world our
astral bodies belong, and our nervous system will become
finer, and thus make it possible to register our investigations
more completely in our physical bodies. That will be
one point that we shall have to bear in mind in looking
for the new doors that are opening. But not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
physical body is growing finer, but in addition to that
our next body is organising itself and gradually unfolding
its powers, the body that we shall wear on the other
side of death as well, the body that we are wearing now
through which our emotions are showing. For when we
pass through death we do not pass unclothed into another
world; we throw off this denser garment of the
physical body, but penetrating that, interfused with
that, intermingling with that now is the finer matter of
the world on the other side of death, growing ready for
our use in that further world, and organising itself
gradually for the experiences that there we shall meet.
And in the next race, as I shall try to show you more
fully hereafter, that body will become highly organised,
greatly developed, a thorough vehicle of consciousness
as the physical body is to-day, and by the growth and
organisation of that the new doors will open before us
in Religion, in Science, and in Art.</p>

<h4>I.—<span class="smcap">Religion.</span></h4>

<p>Let us see, first, how this will affect Religion. The unfolding
of the deeper strata of consciousness will bring
our inner selves, the Spirit, into more and more direct
touch with the spiritual regions of our universe. I am
now not dealing with the finer worlds of matter, but with
the spiritual realities which belong to the spiritual life.
The nature of God, the consciousness of His presence
everywhere, the recognition of His life as an indwelling
power—all these will become fundamental realities for
the unfolding Spirit in man. I pointed out to you, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
dealing with the deadlock in religion, with regard to the
idea of God, that no amount of reasons addressed to the
intellect could ever lead us to an absolute demonstration
of the existence, the reality of God. Probability, yes;
cumulative evidence, yes; but demonstration, no. When
a thing is once demonstrated, no further challenge arises
about it; when once a fact is demonstrated, no one any
longer asks: Does that fact exist? and we have been
in the region of arguments about God, and not of that
spiritual knowledge of God which is eternal life. How
is that to be reached? Not by any effort of the reasoning
intelligence, not by any upreaching of the merely
emotional nature, but by the unfolding in man himself of
that Spirit which is divine in its essential quality, which,
because itself divine, can respond to divinity without,
and, because itself is God, knows that God of which it is
the offspring. This is the ultimate truth of religion, the
human experience of communion with God in the depths
of the human Spirit; for religion is only a groping after
God, a search after God; ceremonies and rites, churches
and scriptures, they are all external; they can never
reveal God to the Spirit, which is of His own likeness
and image.</p>

<p>Only the Spirit can know Him, only the Spirit can
find Him; while it searches through matter it can only
hope He is, but the unveiled Spirit can feel the unveiled
Godhead, and by the identity of nature can know that
God is, and is itself. And as this inner spiritual life
more and more awakens in the religions of the world,
man will know the truth of that great saying of the
Christ: “The Kingdom of God is within you.” As you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
go down into the depths of your own being, there shall
you find Deity, the conviction that God is and must be.
For you can strip away from yourself everything that is
not He, until only He, the one Self of all, remains. You
can mutilate your body and lose your limbs, but <em>you</em>
remain. Your emotions can grow worn out and be
withered, but behind your emotions <em>you</em> still are there.
Your mind may grow weaker, feebler, may become, as it
were, paralysed for reasoning, and yet <em>you</em> are there,
behind the failing mind; and if you are willing to pass
on into spiritual experience, to let your emotions be
quieted, to let your mind be still, then in the silence of
the emotions, in the tranquillity of the mind, you shall
find a deeper consciousness, a deeper life, a more real
individuality; and as the emotions are still and the mind
is silent, in the innermost depths of the Spirit you shall
find yourself and God. And then, contemplating that
mighty and eternal life, you shall feel that you share it,
that you are part of it, that you cannot be separated
from it, and, in a great gush of experience that never
again you can doubt, you shall know the reality of Deity
in finding the reality of yourself. That is the ultimate
conviction that nothing can shake—that the human experience
that many a man has had, that for him has transformed
the world; that is the sure ground of the religion
of the future, that the rock on which a true faith
alone can be based; and it is written, and truly written,
in an ancient Hindū scripture, that the only proof of
God lies in the witness of the Self. On that rock religion
will base itself, fearless of all attack, of all assault. No
question of chronology can move it, for every man can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gain that experience for himself; no criticism and destruction
of scriptures can tear this in pieces, for it is
ever renewing in the perennial life of the Eternal Spirit;
no churches, in failing, can shake it, for it is this that
made churches, to help in its own searching; nothing
outside can touch it, for it lives in the innermost heart
of man. And in that, ever-opening new experiences,
fuller knowledge, deeper understanding, more abounding
love, and unchanging peace and bliss. Everything
else may go, but this remains unchanging; and as out
of this all has come, the perishing of the transient matters
not, for the Eternal Source remains.</p>

<p>But that is not the only new door, though the most
important one, which opens to religion. You remember
that I said, that with the unfolding consciousness a more
delicately organised body was evolved. And so we find
that new senses, new powers awake in the material tabernacle
with this unfolding of the divine Spirit in man. The
senses which belong to the higher worlds are very near
to the opening in every one of you; and if you ask me
why I say it, my answer is very simple, because, taking,
say, any dozen of you, dulling the physical senses by
what is called mesmerism, or hypnotism if you will, so
that you cannot see physical things, cannot hear physical
sounds, cannot taste or smell or touch so that the senses
answer to objects outside—under those conditions in
about ten out of every dozen these inner senses are able
to make themselves manifest, are able to bear witness to
the existence of a subtler world. Now when you find that
by an artificial process of that kind an ordinary man
or woman can be made what is called clairvoyant or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
clairaudient, or able to touch and feel things that the
ordinary physical touch does not reveal; when you find
that by stilling the physical these rudimentary senses
are able to work—within limitations, but still to work—it
is a fairly clear proof that man is on the threshold of
unfolding those senses that now are rudimentary, and
that need an artificial condition in order to show themselves.
But they do show themselves under that artificial
condition. If they were not there they could not show
themselves, no matter how much you might paralyse the
dense physical body; it is only because they are there
that they can function. But when the rougher senses
are active, those stronger vibrations dull the delicate
vibrations of the rudimentary and dawning senses. It is
only because they are present, but only partly developed
that you are able to make them manifest in the great
majority which might be taken from a meeting such as
this.</p>

<p>Now, not only is that true—and I mention that first
because that is practically universally recognised by
science now—but they may be artificially stimulated
without the help of mesmerism at all. While that is a
rough-and-ready way of doing it with anybody, the other
means requires a consciousness unfolded to the point
where the fact of these senses is recognised as probable,
and then a deliberate and sustained effort to bring these
senses into working order. Now that is done by what
is known generally as meditation, and meditation is only
concentrated thinking. Anyone who is able to pay attention,
any one who is able to think steadily on one subject
for a little time without letting the mind wander,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
is ready to begin meditation; and most of all are those
ready to begin it, although at first sight they might not
look promising, who are capable of being seized upon by
a single idea of a high and lofty character; which, as it
were, takes possession of them, obsesses them if you
will, so that they become martyrs, heroes for the idea
which has gripped them. I do not say that is the highest
state—it is not; it is not best to be possessed by the idea,
but to possess the idea—that is a stage higher still. But
the power of being possessed by an idea shows that you
are climbing upwards towards the realms of the ideal;
and many a man or woman who is marked out as a
fanatic, as unwilling to be reasoned out of their foolish
ideals, the dreamers of the world, the Utopians, the
poets who dream of a coming golden age, those men and
women who despise the present, sometimes irrationally,
in the wild enthusiasm of the idea that has possessed
them, they are treading on the threshold of that power
of concentration of the mind which, when they have
mastered their ideas, should carry them far on—on to
the next stage in human progress. It is by meditation
that these senses are artificially awakened; that is, you
quicken the normal workings of evolution by knowing
the laws of thought, and utilising them to bring about
that which you desire. It is only artificial in the same
sense that a cattle-breeder, when he wants to breed a
particular type, uses those laws of nature that help him,
and avoids or evades those that would hinder him. He
clears out of his way all the opposing forces and energies,
so that those he wants may have free play. So with the
laws of mind; if you know the laws of mind, the laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
by which consciousness evolves, then you can use them
scientifically to develop in yourselves the highest powers
of the mind, and use those powers of the mind to organise
your subtler body, so that it may become a vehicle
of consciousness, may be obedient to your will to
know. That is already stirring within you; hence the
nervous troubles that you have; but when you understand
the law, you can evolve the finer nervous system
without peril to health. Only this demands rules which
many people kick against, a physical self-mastery that is
not popular in the luxurious and ease-seeking civilisation
of our time; to make your physical body only an
instrument, to allow it to eat only what you choose for
it as best suited to your purpose, to allow it to drink that
alone which suits your aim, to allow it to sleep just as
long as, and no longer than, conduces to that object that
you have set before yourself—to make the body the
servant, and not the master, or even the equal, of the
Spirit—that is the regimen which has to go with the
quicker evolution of the astral body and the keener
senses which belong to it. Many are doing it amongst
us now; nature is doing it, but not so rapidly as man can
do it by working with nature.</p>

<p>On the western coast of America, along the Californian
district, where the electric conditions are very peculiar,
one of the games the children like is to run along the
carpet, rubbing their feet along the carpet as they go.
This charges them so highly with electricity that if you
turn on a gas-jet they can put a finger to it and light it.
These are things that are well known over there, and
with that peculiar electrical condition the tension of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
nervous system is higher, and so these senses are very
much more common there than they are in our damper
and less brilliant electrical atmosphere. That, however,
is coming for all; there partly by natural conditions;
here, if you choose to do it, by deliberate working with
nature along the line of evolution.</p>

<p>Now, what will be the effect of evolving those astral
senses? That the next world will form part of this world
to you, so that in religion a large number of things that
now are matters of faith will become matters of everyday
knowledge. There will be no need then to talk
about human personality persisting on the other side
of death, for you will see your dead all around you, as
some are able to see them even now. Death will be only
going into another room in the house that we are all
living in, and even the walls will become transparent, so
there will be no real separation; it will no longer be necessary
for the clergy to preach about the life on the
other side of death, for all the congregation will see that
it exists; it will be no longer necessary to talk about the
results in that life of what we are doing here, for the
results will be open before our eyes, as they are open
to the eyes of the seers of to-day; there will be no need
then to say that death cannot divide, for all will know
that their beloved are with them—tangible, visible,
audible.</p>

<p>Now, these things are so to an ever-increasing number
of our own race at the present time; they will become
general as evolution proceeds. And the result of that
will be that very many of the secondary teachings of
religion will become palpably true to the great majority;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
not only the question of the life after death and the
conditions that rule there, but also the value of many
church rites and ceremonies that the sceptical and materialistic
mind of the moment looks on with scorn and
contempt as ancient superstitions. There is such a
thing as the sacramental life; there is a bridge between
this world and the next in those sacraments of the
Churches possessed by every great religion, and not by
the Christian alone. Much of that has been lost to
western Christendom by the Reformation, which rejected
the occult because it had been abused, and superstition
believed without understanding. But, none the
less, in the great sacraments of the Church there remains
a potency which without that sacrament you cannot
reach, a real communication of the spiritual to the
material, a real down-flowing of the higher life: a thing
which is visible to the eye of the seer, although invisible
to the normal worshippers in the churches. And gradually,
as these senses become common, those ancient
traditions will again be justified in the minds of all, and
men will again know that in those divinely given offices
of religion there is a mighty potency, a living spiritual
reality. You do not need them when you have opened
up your Spirit to the higher realities of the spiritual
world, but how few there are who are really open to
these in their daily lives; the sacraments are the bridges
that unite the worlds, and it is foolish to throw them
aside until you have built a perpetual bridge within
yourself.</p>

<p>All along those lines you will readily see how many
doors will open in religion where knowledge will justify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
what humility and faith have received. And along those
lines religion, without ceasing to be spiritual, will be
rational and scientific as well, and you will realise that
Occult Science justifies religion, and can make a rational
and scientific defence for many of its rites and ceremonies,
for many of its teachings that now rest on authority
and tradition. I have not time to go further
along that line; I have indicated to you the ways along
which the doors are opening both in the spiritual unfolding
to the higher realities, and the unfolding of the
higher senses which will gradually bring the next world
within man’s ken.</p>

<h4>II.—<span class="smcap">Science.</span></h4>

<p>Let us turn to Science, and see how far similar doors
are opening there for the science of our day. You may
remember that I pointed out to you that science was
now rather at its wits’ end as regards observation. It
seems to have reached the limit of the delicacy of its
outer apparatus. How shall it continue to observe?
By means of those same senses that I have been speaking
of in relation to the verification of religious teachings,
but in science you can begin a little lower down.
In the physical world of matter, our own world, science
is now recognising not only solid, liquid, gas, but also
ether, and beyond ether, possible finenesses arising, so
that there may be many ethers, as indeed was suggested
in that famous classification of vibrations which Sir
William Crookes gave in one of his addresses a few years
ago. Let it stand for the moment as a matter of observation
of higher sight that there are more ethers than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
one that science will gradually conquer. But science is
not yet able to see even the chemical atom, and that is
only on the plane of the gas, the third fineness of matter.
The atom escapes by its subtlety, by its minuteness, and
yet it would not be a very difficult thing for most of you
to develop in yourselves the power of seeing as far as
that, for it is only physical matter. It is not now the
seeing of another kind of matter altogether, like that of
the astral world; it is only the making a little keener of
your present physical sight. Now I wonder how many
of you, if you were on board ship, quiet, with the air
very pure, if you looked into the atmosphere around you,
would see dancing in that atmosphere a number of tiny
brilliant sparks. Probably a large number of you. Try
it next time you happen to be out on the sea. Sit with
your back to the sun, otherwise your eyes will become
dazzled; fix your gaze at the distance at which you can
see an object clearly, so as not to strain the eyes; focus
your eyes, say at a distance of four or five yards away,
not near enough to cause any strain by the crossing of
the eyes; you must not cross the axes of the eyes, that
is, you must not squint; that, prolonged, will injure the
eyes. Let them look quite easily out a few yards away
from you into the empty air, and stay quite quietly looking
at that point. Probably most of you presently would
begin to see a number of brilliant little sparks dancing
like motes in a sunbeam. One word of warning I must
give you: if, in fixing your attention on one of those,
it slowly glides away out of sight, round the corner as
it were, then it is only something in the retina, and
the humour of the eyes carries that gradually away;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
anything that gradually slides out of sight belongs to the
physical retina of the eye, and is not outside yourself.
But if they dance up and down in every direction, exactly
as the dust in a ray of light coming through a shutter,
then you may be sure that you are seeing something
in the air beyond your ordinary vision. Look at them
easily, not straining your vision, but with the will to
see—every organ of sense is evolved by the will of the
Spirit behind it—the will to see more plainly, and gradually
you will find that those dancing sparks of light can
be stopped by your will to look at them, until they will,
as it were, hang in the air like minute sparks without the
rapid motion. You have begun then to develop etheric
sight, and going on steadily along similar lines you would
find that before very long the atom of the chemist would
become visible to you. Of course, this is possible to any
clairvoyant who possesses real clairvoyance, and not
only a dim response to vibrations outside that are not
understood. Two years ago, under favourable conditions,
two of us who had developed some of these higher
kinds of sight set to work on the atoms of the chemist.
We examined some fifty-five or fifty-six of them, drew
the forms, and since then have examined all the rest that
are known to science. Those forms fall into classes; they
can be drawn so that anyone who is now able to see
them can test his own vision if he pleases by that which
we have put on record; and you will find in that work,
which we published under the name of <cite>Occult Chemistry</cite>,
pictures of the chemical elements, observations as to
their breakings up into finer and finer forms of ether, and
possibly to the trained chemist suggestions of experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
by which he may guide his own investigations, and
by utilising what we have seen as scientific hypotheses
to him, although facts to us, may be able to follow these
subtle and elusive particles of matter further than he has
been able to follow them by any instrument that he is
able to manufacture. For when a thing is once done, it
is possible then to verify it over and over again; when
once the pictures have been made, it is easy for others to
see them and verify their details; and along that line
opens up a whole vast series of new observations by man
developing within himself instruments of observation
keener than those he possesses by his apparatus and his
machinery. Along that line physical research may go.
As these senses become commoner and commoner, investigations
may be carried on by scientists into the subtler
worlds on whose thresholds they now are standing,
until we shall be able to have a chemistry founded
on direct observation which shall carry us right up to the
ultimate atom of the physical plane, and make practicable
those so-called dreams of the Alchemist, which are only
practicable by bringing together atoms of a finer kind
than the gaseous, and so leading to aggregations that
make the elements along the lines that the chemist desires,
he doing in his laboratory what nature has done
outside. And so along that line to chemistry, to electricity,
new powers of observation will extend the bounds
of science.</p>

<p>And in medicine the same is true. Now medicine is
to some extent, especially on the Continent, profiting by
this clear seeing. It is not an uncommon thing in a
Paris hospital for the doctors to look for someone who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
is sensitive, to hypnotise that sensitive person, to half
awaken him, so that he is what is called “lucid” or
“clairvoyant,” to take him then to the bedside of the
patient and get him to describe the inner condition of
the organs of that patient. Diagnoses are being made in
that way now in several of the Paris hospitals, enormously
facilitating the work of the physician, and even
of the surgeon. It is only seeing by what you call the
Röntgen rays. The human eye can develop the power
to see by those rays, and then you don’t want your screens
and all the rest of your apparatus, for direct vision will
do what is now done imperfectly by apparatus. Once,
in speaking about this, I pointed out that all that the
doctors had done was to give a new label to a power that
had been recognised by many right back in the last century.
They don’t call it clairvoyance—I use that word—they
call it internal autoscopy. After all, a rose by
any other name smells as sweet. Clairvoyance is just
as useful when it is described in seven syllables as when
it is described in three the power is the same; and that
is now being used, as I say, for medical purposes. As
that extends, as the action of drugs can be watched,
as the physician can see what he is doing instead of
groping, then medicine will become what it ought to
be—a science of healing; and instead of the miserable
practice of vivisection you will have the clairvoyant
vision, which directs alike the scalpel of the surgeon or
the prescriptions of the physician.</p>

<p>But that is not the only door which is opening before
medical science. Doctors are beginning to realise the
enormous value of the power of mind in the treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of disease. Along this line the way has been led as
usual by the great hosts of people who are banned as
charlatans by modern science—Christian Scientists,
Mental Scientists, faith curers of all sorts. These are
the things that are leading the medical profession slowly
along sounder lines of cure, along safer methods of
healing. Most doctors will now admit that to get the
mind of the patient with them is to double the value of
their drugs; most doctors will admit that the use of the
imagination by the patient is an immense help in the
curing of any disease. On every side you may see that
these methods are being taken up by medical men, and
are being rendered more and more scientific. What is
the law that underlies them all? That the mind creates;
that the mind is the one great creative power in the universe,
divine in the universe, human in man; that as the
mind can create, so can it restore; that where there is
injury, the mind can turn its forces to the healing of the
injury; that where harm has happened to the body, the
mind can bring a remedy and strengthen the action of the
drugs that are given by the physician. And I see now
that in the Anglican Church there are several guilds of
healing by the action of prayer—which is concentrated
thought—by the touch of consecrated oil—which is a
sacramental function—and by the faith of the patient,
which is the determination of the mind to work in the
direction which is desired by the sufferer. Now there
is nothing new in that, nothing that has not been known
in the world for thousands of years. It was pushed out
of sight by a science that depended only on material
means; it is coming back with the supremacy of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
over matter, and with the recognition which science is
now making, that it is life which is the evolver and the
moulder of matter. As medicine goes along that line
instead of along the lines of torture, the doctor will
again become the healer instead of the poisoner that
he too often is to-day.</p>

<p>In psychology the same is true; new doors are opening
there. These higher bodies of man that I spoke of at
the beginning, as they become organised, bring us into
touch with one region after another of the universe
around us, answer to vibrations from the outer world
far away from our physical globe, bring us into contact
with the subtler regions, the regions of thought as well
as the regions of Spirit. As our consciousness makes
its vehicles more plastic, more useful, more keen, more
subtle, we shall find the consciousness far larger than
we dreamed of, until at last we shall realise that this
human consciousness of ours is only like a vast body
touching delicately, as it were, the surface of the physical
matter of the globe, putting a little more of itself
down into the physical brain that is more sensitive, but
ever transcending the physical, and using the higher,
finer matter for its keener instrument, until at last we
shall realise that genius of every kind is only the manifestation
of a larger consciousness that each of us possesses,
only we are not able to make it work through the denser
matter of our brain. And we shall realise that all that the
Prophets have said, all that the great Mystics have told
us, all those things are only the fruits of a wider consciousness
contacting a wider world, and that before psychology
is unfolding an enormous range of possibilities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in which man will be in touch with other worlds than
this, and in which he will climb higher and higher, until
he realises that he is cosmic, not planetary, and belongs
to a vaster system, and not only to one tiny world. Along
those lines, and along many another, then, the finer
sense is opening to science new doors, new avenues of
knowledge.</p>

<h4>III.—<span class="smcap">Art.</span></h4>

<p>And what of Art? Here, again, these senses will be
the builders of the new art, the givers of the new ideals;
and there are already signs, in the world of painters
more especially, of new powers which are opening, new
splendour of colour, and new wedding of emotion to
colour also. A new school of painters is beginning to
grow up, some in this country, one at least in Belgium,
several in Hungary. I was looking at their paintings
only three or four days ago, in which new use of colour
is being shown to indicate the higher emotions of the
mind, in which the painter is throwing into forms of
new beauty, glorious in new brilliancy of colour, the
higher thoughts and emotions which show themselves especially
in religious feelings. There was one painting
that was hanging in the hall in which we were holding our
International Congress, which from the further end of
the hall seemed as though it were impossible as a mere
painting on opaque canvas. As you looked at it from a
distance it seemed as though the colour were transparent,
as though the canvas were transparent, as though
there were a light beyond the painting shining through
the colours from behind. Now, there is something of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that quality in the paintings of Mr. Mortimer Menpes
which he did in Japan. It shows so strongly that I
remember, in one exhibition of his paintings, that people
looking would hardly believe that a light had not been
hidden behind the painting, so extraordinary was the
brilliance that seemed to shine through; but if you talked
to that great colourist, you would find that he sees
colours in quite a different way from you, or at least I
will say I found he saw them in quite a different way
from my normal sight, and in talking to him about the colours
that he saw, I was able to recognise, having unfolded
some of the higher vision, that he was seeing astral
colours, and not physical, and that the effort to throw
those upon the canvas brought about the remarkable
results which everyone wondered over, though they did
not understand. Now there are many artists who are
growing up along that line, who are groping after new
possibilities of colour as well as after new ideals which
they seek to limn, and you will find in the more modern
paintings of that school, at present so small but with the
promise of the future in it, that they are seeking after
new forms of beauty; that they are trying to translate
some of the higher visions that belong to worlds of matter
subtler and finer than our own; that they are beginning
to draw down from the ideal great thoughts, which
they are putting at present imperfectly into form and
colour, but in which is the promise of the Art of the
Future, where larger worlds shall be drawn upon, where
a vaster Nature shall unfold herself to man, where new
colours and new possibilities of outline shall be found in
every direction, and where human genius shall have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
wider range, because a wider world and wider powers
will come within the power of the painter.</p>

<p>And so we shall see it also in music. That is beginning
to show signs of the coming art—subtler harmonies,
minuter distances between notes, tendencies to quarter-notes
as well as half-notes, quarter-tones; and already
there are one or two musicians who are beginning in their
melodies to play with these subtler kinds of tones, making
strange new music—music which the public ear is
not yet accustomed to, which it challenges when it hears
it, but which is the Music of the Future, when a vaster
range of sound shall appeal to ears more finely organised
than ours, and when the ears of a new race shall demand
from its musicians greater delicacies of musical sound
than have yet been mastered amongst us; and there is
a new possibility there. That has been seized in India,
although little put at present into music that the West
would love. If you go to India you will find some
strange rules of music there: there is music for the
sunrising, and music for the high noon, and music for
the evening hours, and music for the stillness of the
night. Nature has her sounds in all the different times
of her unfolding, from dawn to sunset, and sunset to
dawn, and these finer notes are attuned to these mysteries
of Nature, so that unheard melodies may be mirrored
in the music of human instruments. The Indian
musician would not play to you a melody of the dawn
when the sun was setting; he would say it was against
religion to do it, for to him all things are religious.
It is a subtler harmony between man and Nature;
and not without significance, again, was it that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
at the Congress I have just spoken of, a Russian lady
teacher—for the Russian is very sensitive, a young nation
with possibilities of the future in it—brought to us
what she called “coloured sounds.” She had learned to
translate into musical sounds the colours of the sunset
and the colours of a forest, so that in music she could
play sounds that made arise in the mind the same emotions
as would be aroused in the mind that looked at
the glory of the clouds in the sunset, or that sat in the
wood and saw the delicate shadings of the trees; the
same emotions in the one case seen in Nature, in the
other heard in music, and both changeable the one into
the other, eye and ear, and ear and eye. Along those
lines many new possibilities lie—new melodies, new
delicacies, new exquisite harmonies in sound.</p>

<p>So art will go forward here, with these keener, subtler
organs, further even in one way than science along the
line of observation, for art reaches out by emotion where
science is only observing, and so the poet is very easily
the prophet, and the artist very easily the seer; and as
these powers increase and multiply, a new race arises
in which the powers are inborn. Can you not dream
some of the new possibilities in Religion, in Science, and
in Art?</p>

<p>You think it is all a dream, all a fancy! But to say
that, you must be making the preposterous claim that
evolution is over, and that you are the highest products
which Nature is able to bring to birth. We are far
higher than the savages: should there not be races
higher than we are? Surely Nature’s power is not exhausted;
surely she, who has gradually builded up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
exquisite mechanism of the human retina from the pigment
spot in the nervous ring of the medusa, surely she
can evolve these eyes further and further, to greater
power of sight. It all grows out of the Spirit, and of the
Spirit there is no ending. If you see to-day with your
eye it is because the Spirit in you willed to see, and by
that will built up the organ which made the will effective
in the material world; and that same Spirit that evolved
you in the past is living in you now, and is your innermost
Self; its powers are not exhausted, its inspiration
is not over, it is still the architect of the human body, as
the divine Spirit is the architect of the universe. Ever
to higher and higher forms of matter, ever to loftier and
loftier stages of consciousness, everlastingness stretches
in front of us, as everlastingness stretches behind us. As
we have climbed, so we shall climb; as we have come
upwards from the dust, so shall we ascend to the stars;
for the Spirit of God within us knows no limitation
either in time or space, and the evolution of the future
should be a millionfold more splendid than the evolution
which has made us what we are.</p>

<h3 id="I_Lecture_IV">Lecture IV<br />
<span class="smaller">Brotherhood Applied to Social
Conditions</span></h3>

<p>Friends: I wish to deal to-night with the question of
the principle of Brotherhood as applied to human life;
how we may use it to solve some of the problems that
we find around us at the present day, how we may use
it to make possible the transition from one stage of
civilisation to another, so that the transition may come
in peace and goodwill, and thereby may last, rather than
in anger and revolution, which can only mean a brief
period of the new order, and then another struggle,
prolonged ill-will, and misery. But if Brotherhood is
to be applied to the solution of our difficulties, the first
thing that is necessary is to try to understand what is
meant by Brotherhood, and what it implies. Now,
Brotherhood by no means implies what is called equality,
for just as you do find Brotherhood in nature, so do you
not find equality; in fact, the very name Brotherhood
carries our thoughts to the constitution of the family,
implies at once the inequality of elder and younger, of
wiser and more ignorant, of those who guide and those
who obey; so that if man is to aim at a society in which
equality is to be the watchword, then the principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Brotherhood must be entirely thrown on one side. The
disadvantage of taking the war-cry of equality in trying
to make a social system, or even to fight a social battle,
is that natural law is against you, and that you are dealing
with a fiction, not with a fact. There is nothing
more obvious throughout the whole realm of nature
than the inequalities of which natural order consists;
and if you turn aside from the vaster order of the various
grades of living things, and confine yourselves only
to the study of man, there the same principle of inequality
is perpetually asserting itself. It is not only the
difference of age which always comes in, in the question
of a family; it is the difference of capacity, of power,
of characteristics, of qualifications. What sort of equality
is possible between the strong and healthy man and
the cripple or the invalid? what sort of equality between
the man with eyes and the blind? between the man who
is dowered with genius and the man who is weighted by
dulness and stupidity? Inequality is the law of nature,
not equality; and it is of no use to try to build a social
system on that which is only a fiction, thought out in
the study of doctrinaires, but breaking down the very
moment it comes to be applied to human life. That
famous declaration of the American Republic: “Man is
born free,” and on that freedom basing equality, is
denied by every fact of human life. Man is born a babe,
helpless and dependent; and if the babe were left to the
enjoyment of freedom, he would have very little chance
of growing into youth and maturity. A babe is not born
free, but dependent on all those around him for the
possible continuance of his life; and if it were not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
he is born into a system of affection and obligation, there
would be no chance for the human babe to survive the
first hours of his infancy.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, one full of significance, that
the two societies in the world which recognise Universal
Brotherhood both also recognise a hierarchical order.
Take the great fraternity of Masons. They lay down
the principle of Universal Brotherhood over the whole
surface of the globe, but there is nothing more rigid in
its order and in the authority committed to the officers
than a Masonic Lodge. Hierarchy is there recognised
as the very condition of liberty. If you turn from that
proclamation of Universal Brotherhood to the Theosophical
Society, exactly the same thing is seen. You
have there the recognition of a hierarchy that guides the
destinies of humanity, and presides over the evolving
growth of man—a mighty hierarchy, where wisdom only
gives the right to rule, and where the commands of
wisdom are gladly carried out by the less wise, who recognise
the authority of those wiser than themselves.
And that, in truth, is the condition of liberty. For without
that hierarchical order, where wisdom rules and
ignorance obeys, there is no possibility of anything that
is worthy to be called by the name of liberty. As I shall
want to put to you at the close of what I have to say
to-night, we have never yet seen liberty upon earth outside
the ranks of that great human hierarchy; we have
only seen the rule of different classes, the rule of one
group over another; but never have we seen liberty, for
man is not yet sufficiently evolved to understand the conditions
under which alone liberty can exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>In looking at this strange fact, that the only two societies
that proclaim Universal Brotherhood also admit
a hierarchical order, let us see how far in the great
Brotherhood of man there are any foundations on which
a hierarchy can be based. I am coming, now, away from
that great occult hierarchy of which I spoke into the
ordinary humanity known to us all. In the family,
where the principle of Brotherhood is recognised, and
where duty and responsibility go with age and knowledge,
there we have, as it were, a rough outline as to
what a State should be. But how does the principle of
age come in as regards mankind? For unless there be
something in the human race which bears an analogy, at
least, to the principle of age within a family, we shall
find it difficult to vindicate Brotherhood, much less to
make it the foundation-stone of society in the centuries
to come. Now, it is as true of humanity as it is true of
the members of a family that there is a difference of age.
Exactly on the same lines by which the members of a
family are born one after the other, and in all those
different ages make up the family circle, so is it with the
great family of man. The human and intelligent Spirits
that make up that vast family are not of the same age,
have not all been born into individual existence at the
same time. Side by side with the idea of Brotherhood
comes out the natural law of reincarnation—that there is
a difference of age in the individualised human Spirits,
and that there are elders and youngers in the great human
family. These differences of age do not go necessarily
with any of the distinctions of castes or classes that
you find in modern society, although the great caste system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of India was founded upon this principle of the different
ages of the reincarnating Egos. Long ago, however,
has that passed away, and you have not now manifest
on earth that same definite order as in the earlier
days of our Aryan ancestors in India. Still, you can tell
the younger or the older soul by examining the characteristics
that the man or the woman brings into the world at
birth; by looking at the character, the marks of the being
older or younger leap into sight. The younger soul, unable
to acquire any large amount of knowledge, with very
little moral faculty showing itself, very selfish and desirous
to grasp the pleasure of the moment without any care
for what may be the result of grasping it in the time that
follows, the trivial, shallow, easy-going way of life, the
being carried away by the ever-changing fancy, and with
no strong underlying thought or principle or will on
which you can reckon, very changeable, very frivolous,
easily carried away by every passing whim of the moment—those
are marked out as the younger souls, who
have little experience of life behind them in which character
has been builded, in which will has been evolved.
And when you come across those of calm judgment, great
capacity for acquiring knowledge, power to turn knowledge
into wisdom, steadfast in will, steadfast in principle
ready to look to the future beyond the passing attractions
of the moment, ready to sacrifice a temporary gain for a
larger happiness—in such men and women you have the
marks of the older souls, whose past experiences have
gradually developed capacities, and who have brought
with them into the world the fruits of long-reaped harvests.
That great principle of Reincarnation must ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
go hand in hand with Brotherhood if Brotherhood is to
be applied, if it is to be made a working principle of ordinary
life. For it is out of these differences of age between
us that grow up all the possibilities of an ordered
and happy society amongst ourselves. When the young
souls come into places of power and wealth, then ill is it
for the nation, for then children rule instead of men.
But well is it for a people where wisdom is the test of
weight and authority, where the wise and the thoughtful
and the learned are those who are held to have the greatest
claim to social distinction, where knowledge and
power go hand in hand, and where experience is the
guide of righteousness, the standard of honour. Only as
those facts are recognised—and they grow out of the
knowledge of reincarnation—only on that stable law in
nature can you build securely and strongly the society
that shall endure.</p>

<p>But it is sometimes said: If you are going to build a
society on these great principles, then you have to change
human nature, because human nature is selfish, superficial,
readily swayed, and you cannot build a society
which is truly great out of trivial and superficial people.
The wise are always in the minority; how, then, will you
gain for them the right and the power to rule? It is
true that human nature will have to change very much
from what it is to-day, but then it is changing all the
time—it is no new thing to change human nature. Human
nature is perpetually changing as century succeeds
century and civilisation succeeds civilisation; and when
we once understand the law of life, and realise the
mighty power of thought in the building of character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and understand that law of inviolable sequence which
Theosophists call karma, working in every department
of human life and not only in non-intelligent nature,
when we realise the time that reincarnation gives us,
and the certainty that that law of inviolable sequence
gives us, then we begin to understand that human nature
is a very malleable thing; and just in proportion as we
understand the law, so shall be the rapidity of the changing.
Do you think that human thought is weak as a
force to change human nature? Is it not rather true that
thought is the power which brings about all mighty
changes?—first the ideal, then the action. Let me give
you two striking examples of the only two nations in
Europe that have attained national unity during our
own lifetime; one Italy, the other Germany. I only take
them as examples of nations that out of many States and
warring interests have reached unity as a nation; and
how was it done? It was done by the holding up of the
ideal in both cases, the ideal of national unity. Not
until German poets had sung of the German Fatherland
for many and many a long year, not until that ideal of
the Fatherland rose strongly and clearly in the minds of
the young, not until the poet had made the ideal was it
possible for the soldier to come forward with the statesman
and build those States into one. And so also with
Italy. Long before there was any talk of revolution or
war, long before there was any idea of appealing to
the sword, Italian thinkers had spoken of Italian unity,
Italian patriots had held up the ideal of a united Italy;
and it was only when the ideal had fired the hearts of
the young that there was strength enough for the self-sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that followed the sword of Garibaldi, and made
it possible for Italy to become a united people. For it
is out of the ideal that enthusiasm grows, out of the ideal
and the longing to realise it that the power of self-sacrifice
is generated. What we need to do, then, to change
human nature, is to hold up great ideals before the
young of our time, and those ideals shall fire their hearts
to passionate enthusiasm, until self-sacrifice shall be a
joy and not a sacrifice at all, in order that the ideal they
worship may become realised upon earth. Along those
lines human nature will change; for, never forget that
Human Nature is divine, not devilish; that a God is at
the heart of every man, unfolding the power of divinity;
hence the power of the ideal to fire and the power of
thought to mould the lines of character.</p>

<p>Let us pass on from principles to practice, and see
which of the social problems shows good hope of resolution
by applying this principle of Brotherhood, with its
corollaries of reincarnation and karma. Evidently our
first tool is education. In the plastic bodies and brains
of the young there lies the greatest possibility of a
speedy upbuilding of a noble social feeling. As I pointed
out in the first of this course of lectures, the attempt that
is being made in many directions now to separate religion
and morals, and to give an education from which
religion shall be excluded—that, for the reasons which
I then gave you, and need not repeat, is foredoomed to
failure. Now, it is quite clear why politicians and the
public, impatient of the quarrels of many sectarians and
denominations, want to throw religion aside altogether,
and not bring religious controversies into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
schools. But if you apply the principle of Brotherhood
to religion, it surely is not too much to hope that in a
country where the vast majority are at least nominally
Christian, some sort of agreement might be come to on
essentials for the teaching of the young. In India you
have sectarian religions as you have here, great divisions
in the schools of religious thought; and it was said some
dozen years ago in India, quite as strongly as you hear
it said now in England: It is impossible to teach religion
to Indian boys and girls, for the strife of sects
makes unity impossible, and how should you teach the
children without deciding on what to teach them? That
seemed, as it seems over here, a great obstacle in the
way of religious teaching, and yet in four or five years
that question was solved in India so far as concerns
Hindūism, the religion of the enormous majority of the
people. What was done? The principle of Brotherhood
was applied. Some of us, in concert with some
theosophical Hindūs, gathered together a small committee
to mark out what were the essential doctrines of
Hindūism, and what were unessential and sectarian.
After that sketch had been made, we set to work to get
scholars to collect from Indian scriptures passages which
bore upon these doctrines characteristic of Hindūism,
and, with that material gathered together, a Theosophist
sat down and wrote a text-book of Hindūism. Having
written it, a hundred copies were drawn in proof, and
sent to the heads of all the great Hindū sects and schools
of philosophy. They were asked to read it through, to
strike out anything they objected to, to mark in anything
they thought essential; and when these books had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
travelled round in that way the whole circle of the
quarrelling Hindū sects, they came back again into our
hands with all the emendations and suggestions. Once
more we sat round the book, examined the criticisms,
adopted the widely supported suggestions, with such
success that, when the elementary and the advanced
text-books on Hindūism were issued, they were taken up
by all the sects over India and adopted as a fair presentment
of the fundamental doctrines of Hindūism.
They have been taken up in school after school, adopted
by prince after prince, so that when the great Mussulmān
ruler of Hyderabad in the Deccan wanted to give his
Hindū subjects Hindū education in the whole of the
State schools, he simply took these books and placed
them in every school, so that the Hindūs among his
people might be instructed in their own faith. The same
thing was done by the English Government in the
Princes’ College in Rājputāna, because they found that
secular education made princes who were immoral and
unfit to rule. During the last eight years these books
have spread everywhere, everywhere accepted and everywhere
used. Do you mean to tell me that the divisions
among Christians are so much deeper that they cannot
do what the Hindūs have done, or that you have not
more on which you agree than on which you disagree;
and that you could not teach the children that in
which you are united, and leave them in their manhood
or their womanhood to add the sectarian parts of the
doctrines for themselves? In India, to show you the
effect of this, one of the directors of public education
asked me: “Cannot you write, Mrs. Besant, a text-book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
for the Christians?” My answer was: “Yes, I could
write it, but I don’t think they would use it.” It must
come from so recognised Christian authority. I quite
grant that a Theosophist would do it better than anybody
else, because the Theosophist has no quarrel with any
form of religious belief, and because the whole of his
study leads him along the lines of recognising the points
of union rather than the points of divergence; but it
need not be done by a Theosophist, only by some one
with the spirit of Theosophy in him, and that only
means the spirit of the Divine Wisdom, of which every
separate religion is an expression, so that there ought
to be no quarrel with any.</p>

<p>Supposing that to be done for the whole of the Empire
wherever Christians are found, see how enormous would
be the gain; and it would not be so difficult. There are
certain doctrines you all accept if you are Christian at
all: you would only have to put those into a rational,
intelligible form, and then gather from your own Scriptures
the verses which support and give them authority
to all who look on those Scriptures as authoritative. I
have had in my mind an idea that may possibly be carried
out, of trying whether it would not be possible to write
a Universal Text-Book of Religion and Morals, with
texts from every Scripture of the great religions, from all
the Bibles of mankind, drawing the authority in support
of the universal doctrine, and in that way making a
book that Christian and Hindū, Parsī, Buddhist and
Mussulmān could use; for all their Scriptures might be
quoted in support of the general doctrine, and each
might then add its own specific teachings to that great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
broad foundation, showing the real Brotherhood of faiths.
That is a dream, but I think it may become a reality.</p>

<p>Along that line, then, in our education we must have
religious teaching, in order that we may have a firm
foundation for morals. With regard to other teaching,
what would grow out of the principle of the State being
a great family, with children of many ages and varying
capacities that ought to be equally trained? There
would grow up a system of education in which one broad
common basis would be given to every child alike up to
about the age of ten or eleven years, and then there
would come a differentiation according to the capacities
of the children. You would no longer, when a child has
musical capacity, insist that that child shall get a smattering
of three or four other arts, so that he is not good in
any one, but only superficial in all. If you saw musical
ability you would let the other points go, and music
would form the predominant part of the education of
such a child. If you found power of colour, power of
form, then along the plastic or the painting art the child
would have developed his natural capacity; and slowly
and gradually you would learn that the power of art must
pass into the handicrafts of the nation, and that large
numbers of your boys and girls should be trained to the
handicraft as against the machine-made product; because
there you have the possibility of general beauty
coming back to life, and there alone will the sense of
beauty be cultivated throughout the nation. Where you
see the tendency is literary, there you should not insist,
especially as you do with girls still, that they should all
play a little music, and all do a little drawing, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
learn a little singing; you would let all that go, and you
would cultivate the literary faculty where you found it,
and make that the special point of this more specialised
education. Where you found the scientific faculty, there
you would make that the most important part of the educational
curriculum, remembering only that you must
add to scientific training something of literature and the
ideal, otherwise your science will tend to produce vulgarity
and lack of the wider understanding of human
life. Where you find mechanical power, there you will
cultivate that especially, always remembering that no
boy should leave school until he has learned some method
of being useful to the State while earning his own livelihood.
Unskilled labour should be a thing of the past
in every department of human life. It is necessary that
you specialise at an age which is early enough to enable
a boy to learn effectively that which is to be his livelihood
in later life. A good deal of mistake is being
made in the education of the day, where, when the boy
has to earn his livelihood along some line of manual
work, too much of the literary is given to the sacrifice of
manual dexterity. You want far more practical training
in your schools than you have to-day, and the continual
pointing-out that one form of human activity is not inherently
nobler than any other form; that the man who
uses his hands well is as honourable in the use of them as
the man who uses his brain well. What is dishonourable
is that either brain work or manual work should
be badly done. Your really destructive spirit along all
these lines is: “Oh, it is good enough; it will do.” There
is nothing that will do unless it is done as well as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
are able to do it; otherwise it is slop work, and degrading
in itself. It is not the kind of work you do that
makes you either honourable or dishonourable; it is the
spirit in which you do it, and the quality of the work
that you turn out. Until you can get that through the
nation, as it is not to-day—until you can give back to the
workman the dignity of the artist, and not want every
carpenter to educate his boy superficially so that he may
be a clerk instead of a handicraftsman, spoiling your
crafts and overloading your offices—until you can bring
back that balance of human duty and human labour,
there is little hope of a sane and healthy society amongst
you.</p>

<p>Pass, again, from that to another thing that is badly
wanted in education; but I think that is learned more in
the playground than in the classroom—discipline, the
sense of duty to a larger life. That may sound rather a
grand sort of description to give of the effect of a game
on a boy, but it is true. Where a boy is a member of a
team—cricket, football, hockey, what you like—that boy
will never be a success unless he learns to think of his
side and not of himself, and that is a larger self than his
own personal claims. It is in the playground that the
boys and girls learn many a lesson which makes them
better citizens in later life—the sense of order, the sense
of discipline, the doing your work in your place, wherever
you are put in the field. You may have one place or
another in the cricket field or the football field, but the
test of the boy is that he does his work well in the place
where he is, and does not want to be somewhere else
when his captain has placed him there. That moral
discipline of the playground is more valuable than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
discipline of the classroom, for it is voluntary, gladly
obeyed, and it is stimulated by an ideal, unalloyed
by fear. Hence the value of the playground, and the
value of teaching boys really to play. For the greatest
danger of these so-called democratic nations is that
they have no sense of discipline, no sense of order, no
sense of obedience; without these no nation can be
great. When you get, as you sometimes do get, a thing
that happened last time I was in Australia, that an
apprentice boy at a mine, because he was reproved for
not doing his work rightly, at once left work, and then
the whole mine struck in order to defend this young
scamp’s liberty—there is not much chance of building a
nation out of materials like that; you have only got a
heap of marbles with no cohesion, with no binding sense
of duty nor sense of responsibility, and out of those
materials you can never make a State. Without discipline,
order, obedience, no possibility of greatness.
But all that has to grow out of the education definitely
based on these ideas of Brotherhood, of reincarnation,
and law.</p>

<p>Pass from that department of life, and turn to a
very important question—Penology, the treatment of
criminals. What is the criminal? Criminals fall into
two great classes: one class of young souls, and they
need to be educated; another class of souls whose
development has been lopsided, so that the intellect has
grown, but the conscience has not developed side by side
with it—by far the more dangerous criminals those, and
far more difficult to deal with. Now, the young soul is
very largely a savage, the man at so low a stage of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
evolution that earlier in the evolution of our race he
would have been guided into some savage tribe in some
island or desert, where the rough discipline of that savage
life would have begun the hewing of him into shape—rough,
hard, cruel, but gradually building up that young
soul into a sense of duty to his tribe. Now, as things
have changed, and human evolution has gone forward
rapidly, there are not places enough in the world where
those conditions are available for the gradual training of
these younger souls. The civilised nations, as we call
them, have been spreading everywhere over the world’s
surface, have been driving these miserable people out
of their possessions, have taken their lands, largely
murdered them, have appropriated the land and dispossessed
the earlier possessors into the next world.
What has become of all those? They have got to come
back, and they tend by natural law to come to the
nations who have been most active in sending them out
of their possessions. It is quite natural, if you think
that we live under law, not by chance; and it is not,
perhaps, if I may say it with all respect, very wonderful
that the people of Great Britain have a rather extra
share of those unfortunate savages to look after. They
come into the slum, and there they are born really
savages. If you look at them you call them congenital
criminals. But they are really young souls, without
morality, without much brains, with a certain craft and
cunning and cleverness, but fundamentally young. Then
you find others who have come out of that lowest condition
of savagery, but who are not yet at the point
where the restraints of the society that suits the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
souls are tolerable to them. And so you get a great
crop of occasional criminals, with the tendency to turn
them into habitual criminals. Then you have that other
class I spoke of, the lopsided people, whom I said were
the most difficult to deal with; men who are really
clever, but turn their cleverness to plundering their
fellows instead of using it within the limitations of the
law. That is a large class. Sometimes they just go
over the edge of the law, sometimes they just keep
within it, but from the social standpoint, remember,
there are many social criminals who always keep on
what is sometimes called the street-side of the law—that
is, they do not go within the jail—such a man as
one I spoke of the other day, who had wrecked the
railway system of a whole district in order that out of
that wreckage he might build himself up an enormous
fortune. He is not a burglar from the technical standpoint,
he is not a thief that a policeman might catch
hold of, but in the sight of karma, and in the sight of
the eternal justice, that man who by legal means has
robbed thousands of others of their means of livelihood
is a worse thief than the one who has picked a pocket
and is thrown into jail. There are a good many things
in a civilised country which lie very nearly along the line
of legal or illegal theft, a good deal of which goes by the
name of company-promoting, where it is just a toss-up
whether there is really fraud that can be proved; but
with the remarkable fact that while the companies
always perish, and the people who took shares are
beggared, the company-promoter comes out at the top,
and becomes quite a successful person. Now all that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
from the social standpoint, is utterly immoral, but we
cannot call them criminals in the technical sense, although
now and then they go a little too far, and then
the criminal law catches them.</p>

<p>How should those be dealt with who are really the
young souls? how shall we avoid turning them into
habitual criminals as we do now?—for is there anything
more miserable and more shameful than that a man
should go back time after time till fifty, sixty convictions
are registered against him in the police court, and the
sentence grows longer and longer because he is a
habitual criminal? He has been manufactured into
that. You ought not to treat a man who has committed
a crime against your legal system by consigning him to
prison for seven days, or a month, or a year, growing
longer and longer and longer after every return to
temporary freedom. You don’t use people who are ill
like that; you never find a doctor committing a small-pox
patient to a hospital for seven days, nor a fever-stricken
one for a month; they are committed until they
are cured, and that is the way in which you should deal
with anyone of marked criminal propensities. You
should not punish, you should only help; and you should
take that child-soul and train him into decency of living.
For one thing, you should never have in your prisons
any form of useless labour as a punishment. The
criminal who is really a savage always dislikes labour;
he is always idle—that is part of his youth; and if you
give him a form of labour that is punitive and not useful,
you only increase his natural disgust for every kind of
labour, and make him hate it more thoroughly when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
comes out of jail than he did when he went in. Taking
up shot and carrying it to one side of the prison yard,
and then carrying it back again, or the useless torture
of the treadmill, these make criminals, they do not cure
them.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> You want, when the criminal comes into your
power, to take him in hand as you would take a younger
brother who does not know how to guide himself, and it
is your duty as the elder to guide him; you need to train
him in some honest trade whereby he might gain a
livelihood; you need to discipline him, not cruelly, but
firmly and steadily; you need to lay down the very
wholesome law that if a man will not work neither shall
he eat, and teach him in the prison to earn his dinner
before he enjoys it. You need to set him to work at
trades whereby he may earn his own living within the
walls of the jail; and if, after you have taught him a
trade so that he can earn his living, and outside the jail
have found him an opportunity of decent livelihood—if
then he refuses to work, and comes back again into your
hands, then you should keep that discipline upon him
until he really is cured, even though it be for many and
many a year, for you are training him into better character.
You might make the prison life less of a disgrace
than it is now; give him rational amusement,
amusement that will cultivate, instead of having him
deadened by the continual feeling of disgrace within the
prison walls. You may restrain him—that may be
necessary for the welfare of society; but you should
treat him as a younger one in the national household, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
be gradually trained up into decent living; let the willingness
to live the decent life be the only key to the door
of the jail.</p>

<p>But you may do much before there is any need to send
them to prison at all. There is a system which is just
beginning here, called the Probation System, one that has
been worked in America with very great success, and one
that a late member of our Society, Miss Lucy Bartlett,
has had the immense privilege of introducing into Italy,
so that it has been made the law of the land. Now what
is that system? When a young boy or girl commits a
first offence, he is not sent to jail if someone, a good
citizen, of decent standing and good life, will come
forward in the court and say: “I will take charge of
that boy or girl, or young man or young woman. I will
be his friend and look after him.” Then the sentence is
not one of imprisonment; it is a sentence which is over
the lad’s head for a time; and if he will not be helped,
then it is allowed to take effect. But, as a matter of
fact, that is very seldom the case. This man or woman
coming forward out of the more leisured classes of society,
and becoming a friend to that younger brother or
sister, is, in the great majority of cases, a means of redeeming
that younger one from evil into good; the older
makes a friend of him, takes him out sometimes, talks
with him, trusts him really as a brother or a sister, and
great is the redeeming power of human love in restoring
self-respect, and great the desire for approval. Those are
the motives that are brought to bear on one who has
only just set his feet on the path of criminality, and that
in most cases brings him back to virtue; and the friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that began in the probation goes on through the
rest of life, strengthening, helping, teaching both the
helper and the helped. The system has been in operation
for some time now in America, long enough to test
it; in Italy only for some two or three years, too short
a time; man after man and woman after woman of the
leisured classes has come forward to act as friend and
helper of the one who has come within the grip of the
law. Surely no better application of Brotherhood to
criminal treatment could be found than that; it is the
realisation of the duty of those who are beyond the
temptation to vice to their youngers who have fallen
under its power.</p>

<p>I can hardly leave this subject without saying a word
on Capital Punishment. That, of course, cannot find defence
from anyone who realises the principle of Brotherhood.
Some of you may remember the saying of a
witty Frenchman: “Que messieurs les assassins commencent”;
but it is not from the lower that reforms begin,
but from the higher. You cannot expect your murderer
to respect human life if you have taught him by
your criminal legislation that the right penalty for murder
is to murder again. True, one comes from passion
and the other from the law; but if the law does not
teach respect for human life, how should the passions
of the criminal honour that sacredness? It is not only
from that general principle that you make human life
cheap by destroying it, but from another even more
important. You cannot get rid of that murderer of
yours; you can only get rid of his body, and his body is
the most convenient prison in which you can keep him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
You can lock up his body and prevent him from committing
any further murders, but you cannot lock him
up when you have driven him out of his body by the
hangman’s noose; you have not killed him, you cannot
kill him, you have only killed his body; and you have
driven him out into that next world which interpenetrates
this world, and whose inhabitants are with us all
the time; you have sent him out into that other world
hating, cursing, full of anger and revenge against those
who have cut short his life. He acts as the instigator of
other murders; he stimulates other criminals into the
last possibility of crime. Have you ever noticed that a
brutal murder is sometimes repeated over and over again
in the same community until you get a cycle of murders
of one particular kind? I know, of course, that the
Press, in reporting every detail of those horrors, adds
the forces of imagination to the power of temptation
which comes from the man you have sent to the other
side. In a civilised country no such details of brutal
crime should ever be given; people should understand
that that stimulates the faculty of imitation, and so makes
repetition of the crime more likely. Another reason
why you should never send a man out like that is, that
when the criminal is in your hands, remembering the
lives that lie in front of him, you should try to give him
something to take with him into the other world which
he can turn into capacity and moral sense; you should
remember he will come back again to a physical body,
and it is your duty to make that next birth of his as much
an improvement on the present as it is possible for human
thought and human love to make it. We have a
duty to these young souls around us in order that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
may profit by our civilisation, and not suffer from it as
they too often do to-day.</p>

<p>When you turn to economics, what will be the result
of Brotherhood there? The detailed working out of that
problem will certainly need the keenest intellects in order
to devise some scheme of production and distribution
which shall make human life less burdened on the one
side, less full of useless luxury on the other. But not
along the rough-and-ready lines of the Socialism of the
streets are these great and difficult problems rightly to
be solved. You need to solve them by the most careful
consideration of all the problems which are interlinked
the one with the other. Some system of general co-operation,
of general profit-sharing, or something along
those lines, will be the principle on which the changed
conditions will go; but while you will make the lot of
the toilers far lighter and happier, you will never give to
the ignorant the control over that on which their food
supply depends; for that means ruin. Let me give you
one illustration to show you what I mean. There have
been a large number of strikes in this country for years
and years past, and there is no doubt that many of those
were brought about by the greed of the employing class,
and by the unfair treatment of the workers; but none
the less they have in more than one case—in fact, in
many cases—reduced the workers to a lower condition
than they were in before. I was up at Tyneside the
other day. Newcastle with its adjoining ports, Sunderland,
and the whole coast along there, was once one of
the great shipbuilding centres in England. Strike after
strike made shipbuilding impossible to carry on, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the men could not pay their way. The result is that it
has ceased to be a great shipbuilding district; that the
trade has largely gone away from the Tyneside, and that
those parts are falling into decay. You cannot blame
the men who struck; they tried to get better conditions
for themselves; they did not understand the difficulties
of all these large commercial firms, and that they might
readily make shipbuilding impossible for the shipbuilder
by pressing for a particular rate of wage which was not
too much for them, but more than at the time the exigencies
of the trade enabled the shipbuilder to pay.
And so on and on in endless cases. Careful thought and
deliberate judgment are wanted. Many proposals have
been made by the trades unions themselves—a sliding
scale of wages, arbitration boards, and so on—all steps
in the right direction. But your difficulty with arbitration
boards is that their decision is not always accepted.
When people go to arbitration they hope to get a decision
on their own side; when it does not come out,
they are not always willing to submit. When I was in
New Zealand last year there had been a great struggle
between employers and men; at last both applied to the
arbitration court, but when the decision was given
against the men, the men refused to go back to work.
You cannot play that way with these great economic
questions; no one trade should ever decide entirely for
itself what should be the rate of wage that it is possible
for the employers to pay, for the question is complicated
by many considerations; it is not one trade, but it is the
balance of all trades on which the ultimate decision has
to turn. Hence the need of ability, of power to understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of wide study of economic questions which no
handiworker is able to give. There is where the difficulty
comes in, and where there is need on both sides of a
spirit which shall seek the common good; otherwise at
the end there is only more trouble than before, and the
trade vanishes where the conditions for carrying it on
are made impossible. Exactly the same thing is going
on now in Australia. The men who know conditions of
mining and things of that sort are laying down the wages
which shipping companies must pay to their sailors.
When a P. and O. boat, for instance, goes within the
waters of Australia, they will soon be compelled to pay
their men at the particular rate of pay which has been
fixed on economic conditions in Australia. What will be
the result? The P. and O. boats will not go; they cannot
ruin themselves to please the Australian working-men;
hence the means of communication will be very
largely cut off; and when the harm is done, it is too late
then to cry out for the remedy. Those are the kind of
things that are going on in every direction with the
coming of manual workers into power, because the
attempt to rule has come before the conditions of rule
have been understood.</p>

<p>It is very much the same when you come to deal with
all questions of Woman’s Labour. Woman claims the
right to labour, but very often she has forgotten that
employers can play upon certain characteristics of the
woman that nothing can alter, because they are fundamental
and natural. When a woman has taken up the
trade of the wife and the mother, and then goes out to
work in the mill, leaving the children behind and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
baby uncared for save by hired care, then wages are
driven down because she is willing to work for lower
wages, knowing the misery of the children she has left at
home; then comes the playing-off of the wife against the
husband, of the woman against the man; the children
are the sufferers from the taking away of the mother to
work in the mill, and the man is turned out to walk the
streets because cheaper female labour has taken his
place. These are some of the complicated difficulties
that arise out of what seems the simple thing of allowing
a woman to sell her labour. Women and men can never
be equal in the labour market, because the woman is the
childbearer, and there comes in the difference, and the
question of the nation’s health and vigour. She can
never command the same wage as the man, because, as
I once heard brutally said when I was complaining about
the starvation wage of some match-girls: “There is
always another way the woman has to increase her
income.” That is true, pitifully true; but it puts her at
a disadvantage in the struggle of the labour market.
That which seemed so promising at first has only increased
the stress of economic conditions, has turned
the man out into the streets while the woman is trying
to do the double work of the mill and the home. That
is an impossible condition of things, for which a remedy
will have to be found.</p>

<p>And so to deal with these economic questions we want
the best brains and the best hearts, the widest knowledge
and the deepest sympathy. Those, and those only, can
solve these terrible economic problems of the time. You
cannot solve them by any rough-and-ready means, nor by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
any quick and sudden means. You must solve them by
wisdom and by love, and by realising the nation’s interest
is a common interest, not of class against class, but
of union of all for the common good of the community.</p>

<p>But then it is said: What about politics? On the
detail of that, frankly, I have naught to say, for I am
concerned only with principles. But one thing I would
like to put to you, coming back to that point of liberty
with which I started. People have supposed that liberty
means a vote. You could not have a bigger blunder.
Liberty and the vote have practically nothing in common.
The vote gives you the power to make laws, to
coerce other people; it by no means gives you necessarily
liberty for yourself. We have never yet had, as I
said, liberty upon earth. We have had class legislation
of every kind in England, but liberty never. Go back
in history and you find the Kings ruling, and that built
up the one nation of England. Then the Barons ruled,
and they did not on the whole do so badly, for England
was called Merrie England then, and certainly no one
would dream of applying that name to it now. Then
there came the England of Parliaments, getting duller
and duller, deader and deader; then the England of
Commercialism. And who is our ruler now? Neither
King nor Lords nor Parliament altogether, but on the
one side King Purse, and King Mob on the other. Neither
of those is a ruler who is likely to make this nation
great. Liberty is a great celestial Goddess, strong, beneficent,
and austere, and she can never descend upon a
nation by the shouting of crowds, nor by the arguments
of unbridled passion, nor by hatred of class against class.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Liberty will never descend upon earth in outer matters
until she has first descended into the hearts of men, and
until the higher Spirit which is free has dominated the
lower nature, the nature of passions and strong desires,
and the will to hold for oneself and to trample upon
others. You can only have a free nation when you have
free men to build it out of—free men and women both;
but no man is free and no woman is free who is under
the dominance of appetite, or vice, or drunkenness, or
any form of evil which he is unable to control. Self-control
is the foundation on which alone freedom can be
built. Without that you have anarchy, not freedom; and
every increase of the present anarchy is paid for by the
price of happiness, which is given in exchange. But
when Freedom comes, she will come down to a nation
in which every man and every woman will have learned
self-control and self-mastery; and then, and then only,
out of such men who are free, out of such women who
are free, strong, righteous, ruling their own nature and
training it to the noblest ends—of such only can you
build up political freedom, which is the result of the
freedom of the individual, and not the outcome of the
warring passions of men.</p>

<h3 id="I_Lecture_V">Lecture V<br />
<span class="smaller">The Coming Race</span></h3>

<p>Friends: Some of you who have been attending this
course of lectures may remember that in speaking of the
new doors opening in religion, science, and art, I made a
somewhat hasty and imperfect reference to changes that
would be taking place in the human organism and an
unfolding of the human consciousness, and I promised,
in that brief statement, to return to the subject when I
was to deal with “The Coming Race.” The nature, the
character of that unfolding of consciousness, the changes
in the bodily organism of man that will accompany those
unfolding powers in consciousness, and make it possible
for them to be manifested in our physical world—those
changes naturally fall under the heading which I have
taken for to-night’s discourse, “The Coming Race.”
For it is of one of these great changes in the type of
humanity that I have specially to speak to you to-night.
In order to lead your thoughts to that rationally, and
without gaps or chasms, I shall ask you to consider with
me for a few moments certain great principles of study
which we find continually used by the Mystics of the
past, and in our own day adopted to a very considerable
extent by modern science. The reason why science has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
adopted them is the same reason that made Mystics originally
work them out, and that is, that science in our
own time has been dealing with such enormous periods
of growth, with such vast extent of these periods, that
the scientific man cannot observe; that he is obliged to
try to find a principle by which, observing what is near,
he may be able, by a process of induction, to discover
what is far off.</p>

<p>Now, this principle is called the principle of correspondences.
You find it, as I said, used by Mystics of all
types in the past: the great scientist-mystic, Swedenborg,
of Sweden, based a very large part of his thought on the
system of correspondences, of trying to discover what
was far off and extensive by a study of that which was
near and comparatively small. So in our own day with
regard to science; and I remind you first of that in order
to show you that in using this principle we are on ground
which is recognised as being firm and stable, and is
adopted in all the greater researches which have to deal
with the distant and the extensive. Science has made
specially good use of this system of correspondences in
two lines of its thought: one, that of evolutionary
growth, illuminated by the study of embryology; the
other, that of the evolution of consciousness in humanity
at large, illuminated by an observation of consciousness
in the child, the youth, and the man. If, for a moment,
we stop on the great evolutionary series or cycles
of the past, we shall at once recognise that direct observation
is only possible to a very small extent. It is true
that by the aid of geology many buried skeletons of the
past may be brought to the surface and examined, and
thus light may be thrown on the various classes to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the skeletons in the time of the living animal belonged.
Fossil remains certainly help us to a very great extent
in trying to study the evolutionary past of our globe; but,
as everyone knows who has studied the geological record,
that record has large gaps occurring in it from time
to time. It is exceedingly imperfect, exceedingly unsatisfactory,
and only along some limited lines of evolutionary
study is it possible to find from the fossils of the past
the principle of life as it has gradually grown and
branched upon our earth. Hence, in the difficulty of
thus unveiling the past, evolutionists have turned to the
study of the near, the growth of the individual, the
stages through which his body passes, especially during
ante-natal life, and it was very largely the study of
embryology that threw light on the evolutionary truth.
For it is observed, in tracing the growth of the human
body of the individual, that it passes through certain
clear, definite, marked stages. There is a stage at
which the characteristics are those of the fish, bringing
about some very curious results as regards especially the
distribution of some of the nerves; then a stage which
is that of the reptile; then a stage which is that of the
mammal; and so on up to the highest in the mammalian
kingdom, man himself. From the standpoint of mere
observation from outside, without use of reason, this
sequence invariably followed would say little, would signify
little; but when man looks at that with the eye of
reason, and not only observes the succession of certain
stages, but applies his reason to solve the problem as
to why those stages constantly appear, then it is he
realises that in the body of the individual the whole
evolutionary course of nature is traced and repeated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that in that highest, the human, form all the past history
of the evolution of forms is broadly indicated; and that
while, of course, details cannot be observed, the great
succession is seen there, the invariable sequence ever
repeated in the highest, the noblest form. And, working
back with the light of that, science was then able to
recognise very clearly the evolutionary stages of which
geology yielded up its imperfect fossil record; for there
it found the great age of the fishes, with no higher form
of vertebrate life existing; then it found the age of the
reptiles, then that of the mammals, finally the human
kingdom; and looking over the past in that way, illuminated
by the observations of the present, science recognised
the truth of that ancient principle of correspondences
which serves as a clue in distant regions where observations
well-nigh fail us, and enables us, by the use of
analogy, to trace our way among the labyrinths of the
past.</p>

<p>It is not only along this line of æonian evolution and
embryological growth that science has found help from
this application of the principle of correspondences. It
has found that not only in the state of bodies but also in
the state of minds the same principle serves as its best
clue once again in the labyrinth of the past. It has
found out that the stages of human consciousness may
be traced from the earliest stage of the will to live, then
upwards through the unfolding consciousness of the
child, in the stage of passions of the youth, in the stage
of mentality dominating the maturity of man; and it goes
along these lines into very much of detail, showing us
how at a certain stage the child is reproducing the savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
condition of consciousness; how a little later it grows
out of that into the passional and barbarous; then
through that into the emotional, where art and beauty
begin to show themselves as outgrowths from human
nature; and then on, at later stages, to that splendid
mentality which it regards as the crown of human consciousness.
Along these lines, which will be familiar
to all the thoughtful and the cultured amongst you,
science has been led to new discoveries, has been able
in this fashion to find out many of the hidden things of
nature.</p>

<p>But while this is true, there is a point at which science
always stops. It uses correspondences to explain the
past; it never struck science to use them to try to forecast
the future; and naturally, for along the scientific
line such forecast of the future is practically impossible;
science works by induction, not by deduction, gathers together
innumerable facts, arranges them, classifies them,
compares them, and out of all that gathering, arrangement,
and comparison it tries to find by a process of
logical induction some great principle in which all the
classified facts find their explanation, and thus a law is
discovered. But further than that induction cannot take
us. It cannot take us beyond the facts that are observed.
Nothing in the facts observed presages that
which is to come; and it is only when you use the other
logical method—not that of induction, which is the scientific
plan, but that of deduction, which we find in the
philosophies of the past, which we find in the one perfect
science, the science of mathematics, the Platonic method
as against that of Aristotle—it is only then that we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
it possible by a process of deduction not only to explain
the past, but also to draw out a chart of the future. And
it is by using that noble form of logical thought that
Occult Science has ever been able to presage the future
from the principles that it finds existing in the universe,
unfolding stage by stage. I want, if I can, now to show
you how that method may be applied; how, knowing the
nature of man, we may be able from that to indicate not
only the past through which he has come from far beyond
the range of what is recognised as history, but
also to throw a light along the road that mankind will
travel in the future, seeing the heights up which he will
climb, realising the powers yet hidden within the partially
unfolded and evolved man.</p>

<p>There is one other thing that will help us a little as
well as the principle of correspondences, but, so far as I
know, this other clue of ours has not been adopted or
used in modern science. I say, so far as I know, for science
is going on so rapidly at the present time that it is
not possible to keep abreast with all the details of the
later investigations. This second principle is called the
principle of reflexion. As you may have a mountain reflected
in a lake, and all the peculiarities, the outlines,
the foliage on the mountainside, will be reproduced in
the calm water of the lake that washes the foot of the
mountain; as in that reflexion the highest in the object
will be reflected as the lowest in the image, and as at
every intermediate point where the mountain is reproduced
in the image, the reflexion of the mountain, there
will be a reversal, the higher being the lower, and so on,
until you come to the point of junction between water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and mountain, and there the nearest to you on the
mountain will be reflected in the nearest to you on the
water—just so may we in studying man understand
something of him by regarding him as a reflexion of divinity,
the great threefold aspect of divine life showing
itself out in man. But you may ask me: What do you exactly
mean when you say reflexion? I mean the reproduction
of similar characteristics in a grosser and denser
form of matter. That is what we mean by reflexion thus
applied. Just as the mountain which you see by the air
is reflected in the denser water, so are spiritual attributes
reflected in grosser matter; or, otherwise expressed, the
same, or rather a similar characteristic, works in grosser
matter; therefore with powers more limited, therefore
with faculties less potent. That is the use we make of
this term “reflexion” in theosophical literature. The
characteristics are the same, but because of the denser
matter their manifestation is limited and confined. So
the great Will which brings the universe into existence
is reflected in the Will to Live in man; and as that is the
highest manifestation of Deity, so, reflected in man, does
it appear at the lowest stage of evolution as the one
prominent characteristic of the dawning human consciousness.
In the babe, that will to live is practically
the only sign of consciousness, showing itself out in
groping movements, whereby the will to live is striving
to come into contact with the outer world and discover
something of its environment. And so the second great
manifestation of Deity, the Wisdom-Love which in the
Christian nomenclature shows itself out in the person
of the Son, that reflected in human nature comes out as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the emotions, the refined, gentle, unselfish emotions that
form the second great stage of human consciousness,
beginning with the lowest stage of passion, and gradually
rising unbroken to the loftiest manifestation of emotion;
and then the third, the creative activity, which,
again, in the Christian nomenclature would be the creative
Spirit, shows itself out in man’s one creative power,
the power of the mind, of which one of the expressions
is imagination, that which creates with the intellectual
force of man. The correspondence, you see, is complete,
but how limited the manifestation compared with the
manifestation on the planes of divinity. Hence this
limited reflexion, this limited reproduction, we term the
law of reflexion; and we very often find it hand in hand
with the law of correspondences, giving us a clue once
more to guide us through difficulties and obscurities
where direct vision might fail.</p>

<p>Let us begin at that point I spoke of with regard to
the human being. Now, by this process of deduction,
and seeing in man the image of the Supreme, we are
not compelled to stop our study when we have taken
these three stages—the stage of the will to live showing
itself in activity, the stage of passion and emotion, the
stage of mentality; for we see that above those there
shine out the three same attributes of Deity in subtler,
finer form that we call the human Spirit, and that this
human Spirit, reproducing in itself the three great aspects,
tells us of the future, as the lower reflexions tell
us of the past. So that we cannot only trace, as science
does, the unfolding of consciousness through the
vast ages of the past, but we can follow it onwards into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the future, where that higher repetition of divinity is
gradually unfolding, and trace out for ourselves man’s
higher qualities, the later stages of human evolution.</p>

<p>Now, it is true that in this the theory is not complete
and perfect unless you recognise the fundamental truth
of Reincarnation. No otherwise can you trace the unfolding
of the divine Spirit in man, save by giving him
time and environment by which these successive stages
may be accomplished. For, looking at humanity, we see
that very many men disappeared in the savage state,
where only the preliminary stage of human consciousness
had been unfolded; others we find coming into the
world above the savage state, but showing out only passions,
strong, selfish emotions; others, again, further on,
showing out mental powers, and in them the mind becoming
predominant. But unless you admit here a sequential
unfolding of the individual consciousness, you
will find yourself surrounded by complicated difficulties
when you try to understand human evolution; for if you
follow those consciousnesses onwards, thinking they are
never to return to the school of life to learn the lessons
that they have not learned in the infant school of savage
life, then you will have to posit a heaven or heavens, one
of which is full of these souls that have only accomplished
savagery on earth; another that is full of those
that have reached the emotional stage without having
started and laid the foundation of the savage; a third
that show forth mind, but not the will to live of the savage,
nor the emotion of the half-cultivated man. And
so you get a world on the other side more fantastic than
rational, and you realise that somehow or other in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
scheme of things you must make room for <i lang="la">post-mortem</i>
evolution; and the very moment you adopt that, that moment
you have accepted the principle of reincarnation,
even though you may choose to carry it on in other
worlds rather than in the present.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> With that, of course,
other difficulties arise, but on those I need not for the
moment dwell, as I do not want to deal fully with reincarnation
now. But suppose you accept it, then the
whole thing is rational before you—a spiritual intelligence
unfolding in one stage after another, and building
each stage on the one that preceded. If you apply that
to the evolution of the reincarnating individual, you
see the stage of the child, the stage of the youth, the
stage of the man, and you await the unfolding of the
spiritual man. Or if you choose to look at it in the vast
cycles of the past, then you will realise that you have before
you animal man, passional man, intellectual man,
and you can hardly stop without thinking next of spiritual
man—the four stages that you can trace by this principle
that I spoke of, the deduction from the divine life
leading you onwards to the stage not yet unfolded, save
in some lofty specimens of humanity. And when you
have just seen these stages so thoroughly reproducing at
each point of enlarging sight the other in yourself—the
four stages visible—the three and the dawning of the
next; then in the whole reincarnating life of the individual
the same three and the dawning of the next; then in
evolution the same three and the possibility of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
next—it does not seem strange then to come on to the races,
as the Theosophist does, and to see in the early human
race—that which is really the first that can truly be called
human, although there preceded it a semi-animal man—the
birth of our present humanity. We call it the Lemurian
Race; and it is interesting that Haeckel points to the
lost continent of Lemuria as that which was the cradle of
the human race; so does modern science every now and
again touch on these teachings of the elder world. In
that Lemurian Race was shown the strong will to live;
then came the Atlantean, that which lived on the vast
continent of Atlantis, the existence of which is being recognised
more and more by science by logical necessity,
as it cannot get geological evidence or antiquarian evidence,
the greater part of the continent being whelmed
beneath the Atlantic Ocean. Still, antiquarian research
gives us something by pointing out to us identities of
racial characteristics in places now separated by that
same vast Atlantic Ocean. And archæology shows us in
ancient Egypt, in the style of its painting, in the symbols
that it used, nay, even in some of the human types
that it limned, exactly the same symbols, the same types,
the same outlines of philosophical and religious thought
as in Southern Mexico, in a civilisation long since disappeared,
that was swept away by the Aztec civilisation,
which had become ancient and corrupt when the Spaniards
invaded Mexico. In those two far removed portions
of the earth’s surface, separated by the Atlantic,
we find the repetition of one in the other. And there
are many other reasons on which I need not now dwell,
similarities of fauna and flora, certain architectural likenesses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and so on, which are all leading scientific men
onwards to the recognition of the great continent of
Atlantis. Just as the men of the Lemurian continent
showed out only that will to live in clumsiest form, so
did the men of the Atlantean continent show out passion,
appetite, desire, the whole of their civilisation showing
the marks of this predominant passional nature; that
which might be expected in theory showed itself out in
fact. With that went—as always goes with the passional
and non-intellectual type—a great development of what
in these days we call the lower form of psychism. We
apply that term, as our knowledge of these powers grows
more precise, to the way of seeing the invisible, hearing
the inaudible, and so on, that we find in some members
of the animal kingdom; that we find largely developed
in savage nations; that we find showing themselves
out sometimes among the dwellers in mountains and
in vast spaces where the air is pure, where nature is
still in a fairly primitive condition. It is not precise,
exact science under the control of the will; it seems to
be responsive to impressions of passions, emotions; very
rarely, if ever, to impressions from the mind. And so,
looking back on the great Atlantean peoples, we see them
showing out these forms of psychism that we connect
with the higher animal and with the lower human evolution
before mentality has been very largely developed,
before the nervous system characteristic of the modern
man has dominated the sympathetic system more
characteristic of the animal. And then we come to a
time when we can glance backward and see the method
of the evolution of a new race, giving many an indication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to help us in our study of the Coming Race of our own
time. For, looking back into that far-off history, we see
a selection going on among the Atlantean people, and
we notice that the selection was made not amongst those
who had carried the Atlantean type to its highest and
most triumphant point, but, on the contrary, from a
subdivision of that race—a sub-race, as we call it—in
which those qualities did not show which had made
Atlantis great and mighty, but in which there were more
germs than in the triumphant Atlantean of the coming
development—that of the mind. Some of you will be
familiar with the name of the Toltec, the race, or rather
sub-race, in which the Atlantean civilisation touched its
highest point. Not from those were the germs of the
Aryan race chosen; rather from the succeeding sub-race,
in which, as I said, mental qualities were beginning to
assert themselves, with the inevitable result that as those
qualities became manifest, the others, the psychic, fell
into the background. Look round to-day and you will
see how true that still is with the ordinary uncultivated,
untrained psychic; how very low is the stage of the
intelligence, very little mental power going hand-in-hand
with that lower kind of psychism; and so the people
who were chosen to be the germs of our own great Race
were not amongst the most admired of the Atlantean
civilisation, but were rather looked down upon as not
showing out these faculties which then were regarded
as the most valuable, as falling below the triumphant
type of the Toltec, as people of little account, and yet
people who had in them the promise of the future. Then
the gathering of those together, the isolating of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
from the rest of the then civilised world; the deliberate
breeding of them into a type which was aimed at. For
all the great types of human kind exist in the mind of
the Logos before they are made manifest in the matter
of our earth—first the idea, then the manifestation; and
the seven great types which were to make up the humanity
of our globe in the present cycle of its existence,
those existed as Ideas in the Platonic sense of the
word, those were the types towards which the great
Powers guided the evolution of humanity; and when the
highest point was being touched at the fourth, then
came the preparation for the birth of the fifth. The
same great laws which, on a far lower scale, are used by
the ordinary scientific gardener or scientific breeder of
cattle, when he is trying to develop a new type that
exists in his mind, remember, before he tries to work it
out in petals of flower or flesh and blood of animal, that
ideal type to which the scientific breeder directs his
efforts, those laws help him to-day which, on a far loftier
level and for mightier purposes, were used by the great
Ruler of the Coming Race in order to shape the ideal
type that now we know as the Aryan. If you compare
one of the men of Kashmir, in Northern India, with your
best Caucasian type, you will find they closely resemble
the one the other, evidently replicas of the same type.
I choose the man of Kashmir especially, because he is
fair of skin, owing to his living in a temperate clime, and
because from the shutting in of his land from communication
with other countries, due to the difficulty of reaching
his fellows—owing to that the type has been kept
purer there than probably anywhere else upon earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Fair of skin, blue- or violet-eyed, with hair brown in
varying shades, with features sharply cut, delicate lips,
thin and well-formed nose, there you have one of the
finest types of human beauty existing upon earth. You
find that type reproduced over and over again, with
varying modifications as the sub-races develop, but the
one type is everywhere visible; and in the shape of the
head, with the forehead largely developed, with the place
in the brain where all intellectual faculties can be made
manifest, in that type of head you have the type of
mentality, the Race that is to carry to the highest point
the possibilities of the human intellect. As you come
down, looking at the sub-races, the same strange point
strikes you as we saw with regard to the psychic Atlantean,
and the comparatively psychic sub-race from
which our own was gradually built up. Compare together
the refined Roman, luxurious, well-built, cultured,
and the Goth, who was the origin of the Teutonic
sub-race; there again you see the same thing, the
contrast with the regnant type of the apparently lower
type, the one that has in it the promise of rising higher
than its predecessor. Judging by analogy, following
along similar lines of thought, we can very readily understand
to-day that the type of the Coming Race will not
be that which is the triumph of the present, but rather
those in whom the characteristics of the present are less
developed, but which have in them the germ of something
more, which can unfold in the far-off future into a
greater splendour, a diviner manifestation. So that
when we are looking for those who are the beginnings of
the Coming Race, we should not look for them to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
among those in whom our Aryan peoples show out the
highest types of mentality, of intellect, of power, of
thought. Their work is to carry on the present civilisation
to the zenith. Who but they can lead it to the
highest point? They have developed the mind which is
the great characteristic of this fifth Teutonic sub-race;
theirs the mission, theirs the privilege, to guide that sub-race
to its highest point of achievement. They only,
whose intellect is so loftily developed, are fit to guide the
present civilisation to the point of glory which it has yet
to reach, and it is they who are the leaders of the
triumphant type of to-day, they to whom our present
race looks up as the ideal of all that is most splendid in
intellectual power. Not amongst them, then, should we
seek the beginnings of the Coming Race, of the Race
that shall be; for, using our principle of correspondences,
we can see that now we must look for the germinating
of the spiritual man, not of the intellectual; that which
is beyond intellect, that which is higher than the scientific
mind, the qualities that have shone out in the great
religious teachers of the past, the qualities that characterised
the Buddha, the Christ, are the spiritual qualities
as apart from the intellectual; and it is the germinating
of those qualities now which will make the origin
of the Race that is to be.</p>

<p>But we can see in the race of the present signs of the
changing evolution which shall gradually show out the
coming type of consciousness, which shall gradually
adapt the bodies to the fuller manifestation of the qualities
that shall gradually unfold. For what is the great
mark of such spiritual types of humanity, what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
quality that shines out above all others wherever they
appear upon earth? It is that quality that to-day we
name Brotherhood, the recognition of that unity of life
which makes for all-embracing compassion and boundless
self-sacrifice. Those are the types that we see in
these great Ones of our race, they who have unfolded
the spiritual nature, who show out the glory of the Spirit.
It is very marked that in every one of those mighty
Teachers of the past this is the quality which above all
others shines out as their distinguishing mark among the
men of the generation in which they are born. The
love of the helpless and the weak, the effort ever to raise
those who are downtrodden and oppressed, the effort to
share, to uplift, to make happy—in a word, to save; that
is the great spiritual characteristic of all the Saviours
of the world, and therefore at the present time those
are making ready for the beginning of the Coming Race
who show out in conception and in practice their belief
in the universal Brotherhood of man. They may be
less developed in intellect, that is not what is for the
moment wanted from them; they may be less glorious
in the triumphs of the mind, that is not the material
that is needed specially for the Coming Race; it is these
higher qualities of the Spirit that must be looked for
by the Leader of that Race as the material which gradually
He can mould into the type He has in His mind, and
so out of those germinal possibilities evolve the Man
that shall be.</p>

<p>Now let us pause for a moment and ask what are the
special marks of that Race in consciousness and in body.
In consciousness, clearly the recognition of unity. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
is essential; for what the intellect divides the Spirit
unites. The recognition of life in each rather than of
the separated form, the recognition of the one Self in all
rather than the separated selves that are marked out by
the separated bodies, that will be the great mark in consciousness,
the new unfolding; wherever that recognition
of unity is made, there is one of the signs of the Coming
Race. And then, side by side with that, growing inevitably
out of it, a breadth and liberality of tolerance will
mark those in whom the sense of unity is beginning to
unfold. All that is narrow and exclusive, all that tends
to separate one from another, all that emphasises differences
instead of emphasising likenesses, all those are
against the unfolding of the consciousness that knows the
One in the many, and recognises Divinity in all. With
that unfolding consciousness will come a type of body
of which there are beginning to be many amongst us
to-day. When there is going to be a variation which
will start a new evolutionary type, it is always noted that
those out of whom the variation grows are what is called
unstable. Instability is the mark of progress, or of degeneration.
There is the instability of health, but also
of disease; and with the changing type of the nervous
system you find this instability present in both its forms.
If you look around you at the present time, what is one
of the marks of the bodies in the most advanced races
of the earth? Nervous troubles of every kind, and
most marked amongst the most highly developed. It is
needless to draw your attention to that; everyone knows
it. The greater tension of the nervous system shows itself
out amongst us in all kinds of different ways; saddest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of all, in the extraordinary increase of madness in
the most highly civilised nations of the world. Lunatic
asylums are always multiplying, for as soon as a new
one is built it gets filled, and another is demanded. That
is the sad sight when we are looking around, looking for
the Coming Race; the present race suffers by the very
conditions that that race has made for itself; all the
separative conditions of competition, struggle, class and
individual and trade antagonism, all these are destructive
to the evolving nervous system of man. The environment
is impossible, the conditions ruinous for the
evolution of a finer, more delicate nervous organisation;
and yet the resistless force of nature presses onwards
against the human race, forces it onwards whether
it will go or not, and the evolutionary forces cannot be
opposed save at the risk of destruction.</p>

<p>Now that is one of the lessons that needs to come out
of these studies for the immediate guiding of our own
lives to-day. We are living in an environment that is
destructive of the higher evolution, and at our peril we
leave it as it is when the Coming Race must inevitably be
born. If we would go on we must adapt ourselves, and
that adaptation is the crying need of the time. For
amongst us to-day are being born children in whom this
finer nervous organisation is showing itself already,
children of delicate nervous type, but not necessarily at
all unhealthy; often perfectly healthy, but with the
nervous system so delicately poised that it is always in
danger of jar and injury. There must be many amongst
you who know that out of your own personal experience
as fathers and mothers; there may be born into your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
family a little child whose nervous system is so delicate,
so exquisitely poised, that the child is very readily
thrown out of balance, and suffers quite abnormally.
One thing that it is very necessary for the fathers and
mothers of the time to understand is, that as these children
come to them for protection, for training, for help,
they must remember that they have there organisms
which suffer and enjoy more keenly than organisms that
are less delicately, less exquisitely balanced. Such a
child feels pain where a child of rougher type would
pass through unnoticing. The intense joy which, on the
other hand, marks such an organism is always balanced
with periods of intense depression. Such children
should be guarded as far as possible from all that can
jar and trouble. It is useless to try to make them live
in the surroundings that suit those whose nervous systems
are not so fine. On the contrary, it is the duty of
the parent to try to provide for such children gentler and
more harmonious surroundings, realising that without
those the delicate instrument would be jarred and thrown
out of tune, so that that from which the most lovely
melodies might have been drawn will be only an instrument
fit to be thrown away, destroyed. Think for a moment
of the conditions under which you are living now
in London. During the last ten years London has become
almost intolerable to live in, if only for the noise,
the continual rattle, the shrieking and hooting that fill the
streets; the shaking of the very earth itself under the
heavy vehicles of all sorts that we place upon it. London
is becoming a city where to live in peace you would
want to go about with cotton-wool stuffed into your ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and spectacles over your eyes so that you might not see
too clearly, and with your nose closed so that you might
not smell the horrible smells with which the streets are
continually filled. Literally, what will have to be done
is this: all the more refined and cultured people will have
to go out of these huge towns and leave them to the people
who like them. For remember, there are many people
who like them; there are plenty of people who enjoy
the rattle and the noise and the tumult of a London
street. There are plenty of country peasants who, if you
bring them up to London, like it enormously; but if you
take the London lad or lass and put them down the country
they say how frightfully quiet and dull it is. Why not
let the great cities go to the people who like them, who
will be helped to evolve by them? For, mind, that
which is destructive to a delicate nervous system is the
necessary stimulus for the evolution of a nervous system
of a lower and coarser type. I do not want to abolish all
these great cities at all; but I would say to any who feel
the suffering which grows out of the noise and the rush
and the hurry. Your place is no longer here, and, above
all, it is no place for the children. For the finer the
organisation of the father and the mother from the
nervous standpoint, the finer will be the nervous organisation
of the child; and if they suffer from it, their
best policy is to leave London for the country, and surround
themselves and the children of the Coming Race
with sweeter and better environments. It is not only
that these vast towns that are deforming and defacing
England are an impossible environment for the Coming
Race; we must also adapt ourselves to the new conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
by changes of food, by changes of method in
ordinary living. The food that the great majority of
people now use, flesh, is utterly unsuited to the finer type
of nervous organisation. You may notice how people of
a finer type shrink from it instinctively. Children of a
finer type, when they realise that meat was a living
thing, will turn aside from it with disgust, and leave it
untouched. That instinctive dislike is one of the things
that will be growing very much amongst the little ones;
more and more will they revolt against the use of flesh.
But it would be wise not only to notice how that revolt
is growing, but deliberately to avoid the use of such
articles of diet yourself, if you desire to train your
bodies into a preparation for the Coming Race. For
the body which is nourished on flesh and on the many
forms of alcohol is a body which will be thrown out of
health by the opening up of the higher consciousness;
and nervous diseases are partly due to the fact that the
higher consciousness is trying to express itself through
bodies clogged with flesh-products and poisoned with
alcohol. For, let me take a point of very great importance
which has direct bearing upon this. As the new
bodies develop, and the higher, more nervous organisation
of the physical body grows, the next of your bodies,
the astral, will become more and more highly organised
year by year. The organisation of that next body of
yours, of finer matter than the physical, is going on very
rapidly at the present time under the pressure of thought,
which all educated and cultured people use at least to
some extent. As that body becomes more highly organised,
its special sense-organs come into activity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
then we have what is called a higher psychism, which is
not the result of an astral body unorganised and vibrating
to every passing wind of emotion, but of a body
highly organised, with its own senses developed, and
those senses seeking to express themselves through the
grosser body of the physical plane. Now there is one
organ in your brain which is the sixth sense, the sense
through which all these astral cognitions, astral emotions,
will show themselves down in your own waking consciousness,
and that is the body which very much puzzles
many of our doctors and scientific men—the pituitary
body. That is not, as many of them think, a mere
vestigial organ left from the past; it is that, but it is also
the organ of which the finer internal differentiation is
making the sense for the higher psychic powers of the
Coming Race. Now that is matter of fact known to the
occult student, because he sees that development going
on in his own case and in the case of others around him;
and in proportion as that finer and well-organised astral
body hands down into the brain the various things which
it cognises, so does he find the pituitary body functioning,
so does he experience changes that go on in that. Now,
that body, according to one of the latest discoveries of
modern science, is at once affected by the vapours of
alcohol; it is one of the glands of the body which are
most readily poisoned, and even a very small amount of
alcohol poisons the pituitary body, and chokes its highest
evolution. Obviously, then, if you want to ease that,
if you want at this stage of evolution to put a little evolutionary
pressure even on the bodies of the fifth Race,
and thus ease that, one of the first things that should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
said to you is: Never touch alcohol at all in any form,
for if you do the vibrations of the alcohol poison the
very means of communication between the astral and
the physical bodies, and the developing of them to higher
purposes is one of the marks of the Coming Race, the
means whereby it will sense the astral world in waking
consciousness; hence the instruction that you will have
from everyone who is speaking of this and understands
the conditions: Do not only give up all forms of flesh,
but also take care that your diet is free from every trace
of alcohol. Now, these are laws of nature that you
cannot get over; and if you make up your mind to cling
to the fifth Race way of diet, then you must be content to
remain fifth Race, and go no further. No one wants you
to go further than you wish to go, but the conditions
are unchangeable, and the more that is recognised the
better will it be. Above all, with those children that I
have been mentioning, take care not to try to force
them in any way, nor to induce them to take those articles
of diet which will injure their growing delicacy of
nervous organisation, and destroy that developing organ
in the brain by which they will bring their knowledge
through into ordinary life.</p>

<p>Then let me remind you of the way in which this may
be done. Let us suppose that you desire to hasten the
coming of the Coming Race; let us suppose that you are
not willing to wait for the slow processes of nature,
lasting hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of years,
but want to co-operate with nature, as we ought to do
to-day, having reached the stage of evolution that we
have reached, where human intelligence can quicken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
workings of nature. The first thing that you must do is
to make meditation a part of your daily life. Now, meditation
has three stages: first, the reining in of the wandering
mind, the checking of its thinking from one
point to another continually in activity; then the fixing
of that controlled mind on a single object of thought;
then the contemplation of that object in order that it
may be reproduced in yourself. That process of meditation
is the way in which the unfolding consciousness
may be definitely stimulated, and there is no other
healthy and sane way. By a daily practice of that sort,
the fixing of your mind either on the ideal Self or on
some ideal of virtue that you desire to reproduce within
yourself—as you follow that practice of meditation,
the higher consciousness develops, and you change your
contact with the world. Let me take a case. You come
across a man who is very untruthful. Normally he may
deceive you for a time until you get evidence that appeals
to the mind, until you can argue logically and
prove that the man is not truthful; a slow process, but
one that needs to be used in the present stage. What
will be the process of recognising untruth where the
spiritual nature has begun to develop by the process of
meditation? You would meditate on truth; that is the
first step. By that regular daily meditation on truth you
make your subtle body vibrate, so that the nature of your
subtle body becomes that which answers to truth; then
when a man who is untruthful comes along you do not
have to reason; by the direct process of intuition you
recognise that man as false; he jars you just as a false
note jars on a musical instrument. There is no process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of reasoning, no need to go into evidence, no need to seek
for proofs; you feel him, see him to be false, by intuition
instead of reasoning. Now, I know a case of that
kind in India, although I don’t suppose you will quite
copy my Indian friend, for he was a man who, from his
boyhood upwards, had meditated every day upon truth,
and he had done it for forty years. That is a long time
from the western standpoint. The effect of that was that
he had so tuned himself to the note of truth—he happened
to be a judge—that no evidence could deceive him,
however plausible; he knew when a man was lying by
the jar that he felt within himself. I only mention that
as a special case to show you the method by which this
meditation unfolds the inner powers, so that, instead of
the slow processes you are accustomed to, a direct intuition
tells you the character of the person with whom
you come into touch. I might go through the whole
string of the virtues; the principle is the same everywhere.
In addition to meditation, you must practise.
You must practise in your daily life the keenest sympathy
that you are able to develop; by deliberate effort,
force yourself into sympathy with everyone whom you
may happen to meet; make yourself feel as that person
feels; and above all, practise it with those who are lower
in evolution than yourself, for there sympathy becomes
most useful, and the practise of feeling as the less-evolved
feel enables you to lift them up nearer to your
own level. You must not only practise sympathy, too, in
your daily life; you must practise the absence of the
sense of separateness, the most difficult thing in the world
to do for all of us who belong to this Teutonic sub-race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Our sense of individuality is so strong that in everything
we feel “my,” “mine,” “my property,” “my books,” “my
house,” “my friends”—a continual repetition of the
“my.” You must get rid of that; you must get rid of the
feeling which instinctively claims something that you
call your own as against other people. Now, it is not an
easy thing to do; and the first stages are very disagreeable,
jarring the fifth sub-race type of mind. Try to get
rid of your sense of individual ownership in the things
that are yours. How often you hear a generous-tempered
man say: “Oh, I would have given it to him at
once if he had asked for it, but I did not like his taking
it!” Why not? Because you feel separate; because of “I”
and “he,” “mine,” “his.” The next Race is not going to
have that sense so strongly developed; and if you want
to take part in the building of it, the sooner you get rid
of it the better for yourselves. Practise not minding having
your things taken away and used by anybody who
wants to use them. It sounds strange to you, but it is a
commonplace in India. My Indian friends, when I first
knew them, used to be astonished when I said to them:
“May I use such-and-such a thing?” “Why, of course,
if you want it,” was the invariable answer; and at last I
got to realise that that was a very much higher position
towards objects of property than the self-assertive owning.
Similarly, in India, when you have a garden, anybody
who likes comes in, sits under your trees, lights a
little fire, and cooks his dinner there if he likes. When
one day, again, in my very early days, before I understood
this, I said to somebody: “Oh, but do you like people
coming into your garden like that without asking permission?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
“What else is a garden for?” was the reply.
That is the natural feeling there because of the communal
life which has been universal for thousands of
years. You think of the use of the thing and the man
who wants to use it; that he wants it is the reason why
he should have the use of it. That is a very long way
from our fifth sub-race way of looking at property.
Practise that, then, in order to get rid of this utterly exaggerated
sense of separation which we find in our social
life at the present time. This habit of self-sacrifice—sacrificing
your own whims, wishes, wants, every day
of your life, for the sake of making life easier for those
around you—that will be one of the characteristics of
the Coming Race. And as you do it, you will gradually
find that you won’t mind; that the pleasure of making
another person satisfied is far greater than the pleasure
of having a thing for yourself; that the words of the
Christ are literally true: “It is more blessed to give than
to receive”; not a duty but more blessed, more happy,
so that the joy that comes out of the sharing utterly
swamps any feeling of self-sacrifice. That, again, will
be the great social type of the Coming Race.</p>

<p>See how practically, then, this thought of the Coming
Race bears upon our living of to-day. Those who
would prepare themselves for the part of that changed
type of man must begin building it up in their character,
their emotions, their minds to-day, by meditation, the
opening of the consciousness by practise, the training of
the life into expressions along higher lines. That race
will be the builder of a universal religion, in which
sharing what each has of truth will be the only form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of missionary effort. That Race will be the builder of a
brotherly civilisation, in which the need of every man
will be the measure of what he has given to him; in
which the power of every man will be the limit of his
responsibility. Those will be the great changes that
will come, and you, if you will, may take part in that
changing; you, even in the present civilisation, may hold
to the higher ideal, and try to make it acceptable to the
minds of your fellow-men. But our hope is mostly in
the young, in those who have not yet been hardened in
the brutal competition which marks the commercial and
class life of to-day. The young lads and the young girls,
still plastic, still easily fired by great ideals, with nervous
systems finer in many cases than ours, and hearts warmer
than those that have been chilled in the experience of
life—in them lies the hope of the future. For they shall
make ideals, they shall create them in the world of
thought, and out of the world of thought those ideals
shall be sent into the world of matter, and make the
Coming Race, which shall build a civilisation happy,
glorious, beautiful, and free, but in which it shall be
realised that the greatest freedom expresses itself in the
greatest service.</p>

<h3 id="I_Lecture_VI">Lecture VI<br />
<span class="smaller">The Coming Christ</span></h3>

<p>Friends: Looking back over the long story of the past
we can see certain mighty, grandiose figures emerging
from the great crowd of human beings, men who tower
far above their generation, who are giants, as it were,
with pigmies around them; however far we look back
such figures are ever to be seen, until at last the mists
appear to roll across this great vista of the past, and
even through those mists we can discover the outlines of
great Ones who teach and bless mankind. To the great
mass of students these figures, standing out in the past,
appear very closely to resemble each other. We cannot,
as it were, distinguish Them with regard to Their knowledge
or Their power; all are so far above the men of
the time, so far above the most advanced humanity of
our own day, that it seems impossible to throw Them
into any kind of order, or to understand how far They
are part of one great group of mighty Beings; what
relation They bear to each other we cannot see; what
Their rank in the hierarchy of the superhuman we are
practically unable to say. But as the occult student
tries to study the past, there are certain indications that
he can grasp which serve as a kind of guide as to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
mighty Beings. He sees great world-cycles of different
extent, embracing longer or shorter periods of time, and
he is able to trace some relation between these mighty
Beings and the cycles of the world, the point of time
at which They appear, at which They manifest. And by
this study of the past, assisted by occult methods, these
periods in the world’s story and these Teachers of the
world’s humanity fall into quite definite relations.</p>

<p>We can notice, looking back, that there are four great
ages through which the world passes in its long evolutionary
history, ages that are often referred to in what
are called the mythologies of the past, ages which are
characterised very differently the one from the other,
and in which the whole cycle of the world’s story is
divided. It may be noticed that at the beginning of each
of those huge cycles a very great figure appears, as
though, when the world was entering on a new phase of
life, it were necessary that a special benediction should
descend upon it, a special light should shine out. When
we ask who are the great Ones who mark these longest
periods in human history, we are told that They are
Beings belonging to past worlds, belonging to other
planets than our own, planets and worlds older in the
scale of manifestation; that They have passed through
all the struggles of an evolving life, that They have
formed part of a humanity that long since has passed
away and been numbered in the records of the universe,
too far off to touch a world like ours; that, reaching
through human to superhuman growth, They have
finally joined their consciousness with the consciousness
of the Logos Himself, expanding to His consciousness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
uniting with His nature, and yet never losing that centre
which is the result of Their long evolution up the human
and the superhuman ladder. Holding that centre in all
the life of God, it is possible for Them to draw around
Themselves again a circumference which shall enable
Them to become manifest in any world, in any race.
Where a centre is, a circumference can ever be drawn;
and around such a centre in Deity itself, of the Son
made one with the Father, from such a centre a new
circumference of a human life may be drawn, and such
a Being, mighty in His Deity and yet veiled in humanity,
may appear to enlighten and to bless the world. Among
the Hindū people, whose teachers have carried them far
along occult lines, whose sacred scriptures are full of
occult indications, a special name is given to these pre-eminent
manifestations. They call them by a Sanskrit
word which means those who descend. The name
avatāra may be familiar to you, perhaps. But it is the
significance of the name on which for a moment I pause.
They have climbed up to unity with the God head: They
descend to humanity in order to preserve and help. Such
are the mightiest figures that appear in any world, on
any globe, through the long course of its evolution.
Egypt signified that mystery under a special name: they
called it the birth of Horus. Christianity has symbolised
it under another name—Divine Incarnation; and the
Christian will tell you—accurate in the spiritual fact,
although at times confused in the definition of the life—that
the Second Person of the Trinity descends upon
earth, and he regards the Christ of Judea as being such
a manifestation of the Most High. The main fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
such a revelation may come to man is a fundamental
spiritual truth. It ought never to be lost from sight;
and in every great religion it has ever been said that it is
from that aspect of the Logos that these manifestations
descend upon earth. Christianity recognises but a
single manifestation; Hindūism recognises nine that
have passed and one that is to come. In Zoroastrianism
you find the same conception. Religions, living and
dead, have ever groped after that highest of truths; only
it must never be lost sight of that He who is an Avatāra,
the highest of divine manifestations, has been in some
other cycle of life a man among men, and that it is because
of that long-past experience that a return to those
conditions is possible at any time.</p>

<p>Leave that aside for a moment, and take another
great type that shines out. There is no name for the
next type I am just thinking of except in Eastern lands,
where they call him “The Enlightened,” the Buddha. In
the West that name is constantly connected with the last
of those manifestations, with the great Being born into
the world nearly six hundred years before the Christian
era. He is called the Buddha. But among the people of
the faith that He gave to the world the belief is that
there were many before Him, that there shall be many
after Him; that He is only one among the great host of
revealers of the divine, and that one of those is born in
every world, in every Root Race. So that in every world
there are seven of such Beings, one manifesting in every
Race; but when He has appeared, then He passes away
from earth, having finished even the superhuman evolution,
and passes on, as those that I mentioned passed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
other worlds, in other times, in order to unite Himself
as the Son with the Eternal Father, so that in a world
later than our own such a one may return as an Avatāra,
one who descends. But note that the Buddha, mighty
as He was, climbed to His greatness through the humanity
of our own globe. Climbing step by step up
the long ladder of human life, of superhuman unfolding,
He touched the last rung of that ladder when He was
born as Gautama into India some twenty-five centuries
ago, and then, having finished His work, passed onward
into what is there called Nirvāna, the highest condition
available for the superhuman, that of union with the
divine, though without loss of the centre of which I
spoke.</p>

<p>Considering that great Teacher, let us ask what He
was before He became the Buddha, and then passed
away from earth, His teaching work being over. Before
He took that last and greatest of the Initiations along the
line He followed, He had manifested several times before
on earth, and manifested in the same great Root
Race, the Aryan Race, to which we all and so many
others belong. For before that last step was taken there
was another high office that He filled for thousands and
tens of thousands of years. I do not want in any way
to confuse you with unfamiliar names, and yet it is a
little difficult to avoid them, because I want a name
that stretches back to manifestation after manifestation;
and our own fifth sub-race, the Teutonic, has been on
earth so brief a time, living in the western world, that
it has not yet created the general name which we can
use with regard to these past manifestations. The eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
name is a word which translated means “the Wisdom-Truth,”
the Bodhisattva; the name matters little
provided that you take it for the moment that it signifies
an office, and the office is that of the Supreme Teacher,
not only teacher of men, but teacher, as they would say,
of Gods, as you would say, of Angels and Archangels.
For you must remember that the Shining Ones of the
East are the same as those to whom over here you give
the names of Angels and Archangels. The East calls
them by a name which merely means “the shining”; and
though it is often translated over here as “God,” much
confusion of thought thereby is made as regards the
great eastern faiths. For they, like Christianity, proclaim
the unity of God, the one all-pervading life; and
those whom they call the Shining Ones, the Devas, are
but manifestations of that light, the Angels and Archangels
of Christianity or of Islām. And He who is the
Supreme Teacher has for His pupils Archangels and
Angels as well as men; He is the one who is the Teacher
of all, whether in the body of flesh or outside of it as
spiritual intelligences; there is no other Teacher in earth
or heaven above that mightiest One who fills this supreme
office.</p>

<p>Now, such a Teacher, the Supreme Teacher of the
worlds, makes Himself manifest as man at the beginning
of every sub-race. I have talked to you so much of
Races and sub-races that the terms will not be unfamiliar;
and if I remind you that we are all of one great
Root Race, the Aryan, whether you take the first sub-race
in India; or the second along the basin of the
Mediterranean in the ancient days; or the third in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
ancient Persia; or the fourth giving birth to the ancient
Greeks and the Romans, and then spreading westwards
through Spain, France, Britain, up to the North of
Scotland, and then across to Ireland, the mighty Keltic
sub-race; or the fifth, the Teutonic, now peopling Germany,
Britain, America, and their offshoots—if you
think of those, the one Race including all the divisions,
you will be able readily enough to follow the manifestations
of the Supreme Teacher. Just as in the larger
cycles there are manifestations of great Beings, so has
every successive sub-race the appearance of this great
Teacher as man, to give it the religion under which the
civilisation shall develop, to give it the benediction which
starts it on its evolution in the world.</p>

<p>Looking backwards to the sub-races that preceded the
fifth, the Teutonic, to which the greater part of you who
are present here belong, we can mark in each the appearance
of the Supreme Teacher, taking a different name,
but ever the same immortal Individuality under the veil
of that name. One name that is known to all of you who
are students of the past was the name He took when
He led forth from Central Asia the second of the great
emigrations that passed westward, which āryanised large
numbers of the people dwelling in Arabia, in Northern
Africa, in the whole great basin of the Mediterranean.
He then bore the name of Hermes, a name familiar to
every student of antiquity, especially to the students of
Egyptian thought, for it was largely in relation to that
that this mighty manifestation was made, and in much
of the so-called Hermetic literature the name of Hermes,
the Thrice Greatest, is preserved. It was a name first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
worn in Lemuria, but in this case was used by the
Supreme Teacher manifesting for the second sub-race.</p>

<p>Let me pause a moment to say one word of explanation,
to meet a difficulty that may readily rise in the
minds of the more scholarly amongst you who have
looked back to these past tales. You find the same
name appearing from time to time along the same
tradition. That has ever been so in the past. The name
of the great teacher himself has been taken up by his
successors, who renewed his teaching and carried on the
tradition that he left; and so in the vast spaces of time
that have elapsed since that Hermes first appeared in
the second root-race of the Aryans, others took up the
tradition, carried on the teaching, and the name was
ever repeated. It is the eastern way. No disciple dreams
of teaching there under his own name; it is under the
name of his Master that he gives his wisdom to the
world; and that not to conceal, but because it is held
that to the teacher the credit belongs of that which the
pupil may be able to expound, and so, in humility, in
veneration, in gratitude to the mightiest, those who
follow Him write under the name that they worship, and
so hand on His wisdom, although in generations much
later than Himself. It causes much of confusion, much
of difficulty when the people with the western historical
sense go turning over these ancient writings and applying
their own canons of interpretation to people who
were ancient long before those canons were invented.
What is called the historical sense is a very different
thing in the East from that in the West. Historical
sense here means a sequence of names, dates, persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and that is what is regarded as important; in the East
it means the God unfolding in the various types of humanity
that may appear; and that which they are interested
in is not a special individual who has written
this, that, or the other, but the teaching, the tradition,
handed on from age to age, and ever marked out from
the first Revealer, the name of Him who gave the
knowledge to mankind. I do not want to dispute which
is the better way. I only mark the difference that you
may realise that in the likeness of the name there is
no attempt to deceive the reader, but only to mark
the line of the tradition.</p>

<p>In the second sub-race, then, appeared Hermes. Ages
rolled on. The third sub-race was to be born; the
emigration to found that sub-race rolled westwards into
Persia. Once more the “Wisdom-Truth” led the emigration.
To that people he was known as Zarathustra,
more often called among us Zoroaster. Fourteen of
those are known in the old story of Persia, but the
first, the eldest of them all, He alone was that one Supreme
Teacher, coming down to His disciples, building
the policy of Persia, handing down to those who
came after Him the tradition that went by His name;
and every great high-priest of that religion worthy to
bear the mantle of the great One, he also is known in
history as Zoroaster; and, as I have just said, some
fourteen of those are named.</p>

<p>The time came for the fourth sub-race, the Keltic; the
same great Being came forth again under another name,
the name known to every student of Greek thought as
that of Orpheus. The Orphic Mysteries, the Orphic
tradition—these are phrases familiar to every student of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the mighty past of Greece. But the scholars, as a rule,
with regard to him will say, as was said in regard to
Hermes: This is not an individual; it is only a name
for a succession of individuals. There is a truth in that,
for there was such a succession. The blunder lies in
not realising that such a succession must have an originator,
and that the first and mightiest of the teachers,
to whom everything ran back, is not necessarily a
myth merely because He is so great. Those who started
the Sun Myth have done a great deal of harm in clouding
the story of the past, and it is only as the buried
remains of that past are brought up and studied by the
scholars of the time that people find that many of the
so-called Sun Myths were mighty Teachers and mighty
Kings in the childhood of our race. That has become
more and more palpable as the excavations go into
deeper and deeper strata, uncover more and more ancient
civilisations; so that those who have been made
into myths are now taking on again a semblance of
humanity, but humanity so great, so divine, that it seems
scarcely possible to believe that such Beings lived in
the guise of men on earth. But you can trace down that
Orphic tradition through all that was mightiest and
most beautiful in Greece; you can trace in by the Mysteries
I mentioned, by the names of the great Greeks
who declared that they took their inspiration from that
tradition. So we come to the last of the incarnations
of that great Being until He appeared as Gautama, became
the Buddha, passed away as teacher from the
worlds.</p>

<p>Now I have mentioned those mighty ones of the past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
because without that it might seem only a dream when
I speak of such possibilities in modern times as well. I
have traced the four latest appearances of Him who is
the “Wisdom-Truth,” the last of the four manifestations
before, appearing to take His last Initiation as the
Buddha, He passed away and became the Son united
with the Father, no longer Teacher, no longer Guide
of our humanity. But there is never a break in the great
succession; in that mighty succession of religious Teachers
the chair of the Teacher never remains unfilled;
there is ever a wise one to fill it, the wisest who is living
upon earth; and when one lays down the sceptre of the
Teacher, which is the symbol of His rule, another is
waiting by the steps of the Chair of Wisdom to take that
seat of Supreme Teacher as His predecessor passes
away from earth. For never is the world left without
its Teacher; never is mankind left orphaned, without
the mighty One to guard and save; as one passes away,
His function over, another steps in to fill the seat and
carry on the teaching of mankind.</p>

<p>When Gautama was initiated as the Buddha, another
then became what I have called the “Wisdom-Truth,”
the Bodhisattva. His first manifestation upon
earth was at the beginning of the next sub-race. That
you will very readily see, and for that reason I have been
tracing down those names, sub-race after sub-race, that
you might realise the relation between the new departure
of mankind and the manifestation of the Supreme
Teacher. So when the fifth sub-race was being born,
when there was the slow growth of the Teuton in the
forests of Germany, when the germs, the seeds of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
new sub-race were being sown over Northern Europe,
then was made manifest again the Supreme Teacher,
and He came to the world once more to found a new
religion, once more to bless a dawning civilisation. The
religion that He founded, the civilisation that He blessed,
gave to him the Greek name, the Christ. Let us pause
for a moment on that western name—name, again, of an
office. For it was not the name of the Buddha that He
wore; it was not the name of an individual. As we
look at the dominant Greek thought of the time we find
that that thought embodied its highest triumph in a certain
institution known as the Mysteries. There were
Mysteries in ancient Egypt, in ancient Persia, in ancient
India, in all the countries of that elder past; and among
the Greeks also there were Mysteries—the Orphic Mysteries,
to which I alluded, and many others known to
the students of Grecian history under many names of
Grecian Gods and Goddesses, as we call them, of the
Teachers of the past. In those Mysteries there was a
certain grade marked with the name Christos; these
Mysteries the reflexion on our earth and in our poor
worldly mirror of the great Initiations that belong to the
Occult Hierarchy that guides the religious destinies of
men, a shadow of those supreme Initiations thrown
down upon the mirror of earth for the helping of ordinary
humanity. This kind of reflexion is indicated, for
instance, in the Christian Testament when it is said that
Moses, the great leader of the Jews, made all things
according to the pattern shown to him in the mount—a
well-known ancient phrase, the Mount of Initiation—an
indication to the people who followed him as lawgiver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
that the temple which he outlined, which for a time was
seen in the tabernacle that accompanied the Jews in the
wilderness, and then received its more gorgeous presentment
in the Temple of King Solomon, was formed after
the pattern of the heavenly things. So the heavenly
and the earthly are thus related as object and image,
and the object, which is the great Initiations of the
Hierarchy, was imaged here in the civilisations of the
past in the Mysteries, by which, by many ordeals and in
many difficult ways of training and of discipline, the
best men and women of the older civilisations were
guided upwards from the human to the superhuman path.
In those Mysteries there was this grade, the Christos,
the anointed one. It was the grade of the Initiate who
had triumphed over suffering, the grade of the Initiate
who had carried the cross, the grade of the Initiate who
was to know no more compulsory death or compulsory
birth, that which marked him as having crossed the
threshold of the superhuman, and being ready to enter
on that higher grade of manifested life. Natural, inevitable,
that in a time when Greek thought was marking
the highest point of human attainment and dominating
Europe, the Greek name should be taken to describe the
mighty One revealed as Teacher upon earth. What
nobler name could be chosen, what title more significant,
what symbol more instructive, than to call the teacher
who appeared and was slain by the name of the Christ?</p>

<p>In the early days of Christianity, as most of you probably
know, a difference, which is being revived in our
own day, was drawn between Jesus the Hebrew and
Christ the anointed Teacher. Look back to all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
schools of philosophic and learned teachers in the early
days of Christianity, who, when ignorance triumphed
after the fall of Rome and Constantinople, were branded
with the name of heretics—those who were called the
Gnostics, the knowers. A significant name. If you turn
over the pages of Origen, one of the greatest teachers,
remember, in the early Church, you will find many passages
in his exposition of Christianity in which he says
that it is necessary for the Christian Church to have in
it many Gnostics, who should serve as the foundation
on which it should be built, as the pillars on which it
should be reared. He used the word in the sense of
knowers, not alluding to the many schools classed together
under that name. In a famous passage Origen
points out that, while it is true that Christianity is for
the unlearned, while he says it is medicine for the sinner,
it is not out of the sinners and the unlearned that
the great Christian Church could be builded; and he goes
on to say that, while that is true, and there is medicine
for the sinner, the Church must be buttressed by the
Gnostic, not by the sinner, by those who know, not by
those who are ignorant. That was well provided for
in those early centuries of Christendom, for they also
had their Mysteries, just as had the older religions
around them. Turn over the pages of those early Christian
bishops and doctors of the Church, the pages of S.
Clement of Alexandria—canonised as saint for his learning
and his holiness—turn over almost any of the pages
you will of those earlier Christian teachers, who learned
from the lips of those who had received their teaching
again from the lips of the followers of the Christ Himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and you will find continual references to the Mysteries
of Jesus. You will find the rules laid down by
which alone admission to those Mysteries could be won;
you will read in the pages of S. Clement the proclamation
of the hierophant to whom the candidates presented
themselves, he who had in his hands the key of that
kingdom of heaven, and you will find that as they stood
before him he told them that only those who for a
long time had been conscious of no transgression might
come and learn the teaching which Jesus gave secretly
to His disciples. Those were the old words of challenge
ere the door of that kingdom of heaven was flung open,
and only to such men and women was admission to the
Mysteries possible. There they learned the inner secret
teachings, those that are indicated in the Gospel story;
for you remember how it was written of the Christ:
“For without a parable spake He not unto them”; you
remember how, when the disciples asked for explanation,
His answer was: “To you it is given to know the
mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to others in
parables.” You may remember, again, how it was said
that when His disciples were with Him in the house, then
He told them things which to the multitude without He
refused to reveal; and you may remember the further
promise that He left, when He knew that His own earthly
life was drawing to a close: “I have many things to say
to you, but ye cannot bear them now.” The Christian
tradition of the Mysteries declared that those many
things were told afterwards, when the disciples were
more ready to receive, when the pupils were fitter to be
taught. Origen tells us that all those teachings were kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
in the Christian Mysteries, and made the secret teachings
of the Church, given only to those who were worthy.</p>

<p>In those days when many knew, when many understood,
a distinction was drawn between Jesus and Christ.
I alluded to it, you remember, in the first of this course
of lectures; and I did so deliberately, intending to return
to it when, having dealt with the many intermediate
questions, I should arrive at the lecture on the Coming
Christ. For there was a difference between the human
body of the mighty disciple Jesus, born in Bethlehem,
and the divine Power that came down upon that body
at the point of time marked as the Baptism, when it is
written, the Spirit of God came down upon Him and
abode with Him; there you have marked the Coming
of the Christ, the consecration of the Supreme Teacher.
That distinction you find recognised in the Epistles,
though no attention is drawn to it further in the Gospels
after that startling and suggestive statement; but if you
take the Pauline epistles you find yourself in quite a
different atmosphere from that of the history as told in
the Gospels; you find there the name of Christ in a new
meaning, a mystical meaning of profoundest import;
you find S. Paul declaring that he does not ask to
know Him after the flesh, it is the inner Christ he seeks;
you find him saying of that mystic Christ that He has to
be born in the believer—a statement that could never
have been made of the physical body of Jesus. You find
him declaring that that mystic birth of the Christ in
human souls is to be followed by a growth of the mystic
Christ within the believer, until at last he has reached
the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
That is the mystic Christian life, the Christ born in the
soul, unfolding His divine powers as the Christian grows
in wisdom and in love, showing Himself more and more
manifest as the human life unfolds to the divine, until
the perfect Christ is manifest and the Son of God is seen
again on earth. But that old mystical idea slipped out
of the Church teachings, and only remained in the
Testament, marked but not understood. And so He
who was the inspiring Spirit, the Supreme Teacher, the
all-pervading life of His Church, became the outside
Saviour, who by a physical sacrifice was said to have
made atonement between God and man; and you had a
vicarious atonement, a legal substitution, instead of that
identity of nature which made the Christ and the believer
one. That is the change which came over Christian
teaching in those long ages of darkness that followed
the vanishing of the Mysteries that had kept the
flame of knowledge alive, until there were no longer
pupils willing to be taught, and by the absence of the
pupils the teachings of the Masters were withdrawn.</p>

<p>So we realise that with the revival in our own days of
the mystic teaching and the realisation that there is a
life in Christianity which is rightly marked out by that
holiest of names, we begin to see in that spreading new
life in Christian churches, in the revival of that idea of
the possibility of the divine growth in humanity, we see
one of the signs of the coming of the Christ, preparatory
to His next manifestation upon earth. For it would
scarcely have been worth while merely to amuse you for
an hour with the story of the past if it did not bear on
the present and the future, on the repetition of the old-world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
tale, of the remanifestation of that mighty Son of
God. For that reason, to make, as it were, the gulf less
wide between the ordinary thought and the thought of
the Occultist, I spoke about the earlier manifestations,
marking each successive sub-race of man; and if you
have followed along the line of what I have been putting
to you Sunday after Sunday of the stage at which
the world is standing now, of the transition age in which
we are, of the closing age that is passing, of the opening
age that is coming, of all the signs which show the ending
of the one, of all the signs which show the beginning
of the other, then without shock or jar should
come to you the present idea that we may well be looking
again for a manifestation of the Teacher, the Supreme
Teacher of the worlds, who was last manifest as
the Christ in Palestine. Let us see what that would mean.</p>

<p>Unless all that I have been telling you during the past
five weeks is a mere dream; unless the very facts that
I have pointed you to are utterly without significance,
you ought almost to have thought yourselves into the
point to which I fain would lead you now—that we are
on the threshold of a new manifestation, and that the
mighty Teacher again will appear as man among men.
Now, to say that to any people may only make them
think: “But why for us?” So might the Jew have
questioned when last He came on earth. That a thing
so great, so transcendent, and so rare, should come to
earth at any particular time, to be measured by only a
few years of mortal time—that that should be now seems
too strange, too beautiful, to be true. And yet He came
before; why not again? If at the birth of the fifth sub-race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
why not at the birth of the sixth? Some must be
on earth when any such manifestation takes place; some
generation of men and women must be born around the
coming of a Christ; and there is no valid reason that
any one of you can give why this age should not be such
a time, and the people of this age the recipients of the
new flood of spiritual life. Strange, because it happens
seldom, but sure, because it happened at similar crises
in the story of the world; and the strangeness of it does
not mark it as untrue when you see the signs of the
coming all around you, if your eyes should be open to
recognise what they mean. For an expectation is
spreading everywhere of the coming of some mighty
Teacher, and here and there on earth the expectation
has taken voice, nay, has even had a human messenger
and herald to proclaim it. In Persia such a messenger
came in the one who was called the Bāb, who declared
the coming of a mighty one, followed by another said
to be yet greater than himself, and yet a third, the Abbas
Effendi of the present time, certainly a great spiritual
teacher, but one who still declares that the mightiest is
yet to come, who is to bind together the eastern and the
western worlds.</p>

<p>Not only along that line has this expectation shown
itself, but among the people of Islām in a strange combative
form, natural to their fighting races, showing
itself, therefore, as leader in battle to be ruler in the
future; and through Africa you see it in this expectation
of the Mahdi, which has given so much trouble during
our own time.</p>

<p>I only mention these to show you that the thought is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
spreading and the expectation growing; for ever the
world grows expectant before the mighty One returns to
reveal Himself on earth. Such a coming of the Christ
the occult world is looking for—for the same great Being
who appeared in Palestine, for He is still the Supreme
Teacher, the same individual. Who may say
what name He will bear? But what is of import to all
of us is: Shall we recognise Him when He comes, or
shall we be as blind of vision, as hard of heart, as were
the Jews among whom His last manifestation occurred?
It is so easy for us looking back through the glamour of
the centuries in which the great Christian Master has
been the head of Christendom, and seen as perfect man
with the irradiation also of the Christ upon Him—for
the Church has made no distinction between the two all
these later years—it is so easy for us to look back
through all those centuries and say we should have
known Him had we been there. But that has happened
so often. Was it not His reproach to the people of His
day: “Your fathers slew the prophets, and ye build
their sepulchres”? There are always plenty of people
ready to rear the sepulchre of honour to the name of
the prophet of the past; how few in any age of the
world have recognised the prophet of their own day!
That is not only true of the Supreme Teacher, but of
others a little beyond the knowledge and the power of
their own day; ever they have been met with hatred,
ever the world has cast them out, has tortured or has
slain them. Why should we in our own day, then, be
any wiser? Why should the fifth sub-race, the most
combative of all the nations, the most critical, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
sceptical, the most unwilling to recognise the higher, the
most self-assertive—why should we have eyes open to
see a greatness that has never been recognised in the
past? That is the problem that may well exercise our
minds, in order that we may try to develop in ourselves
the power to recognise should He come in our own day.
For one great rule runs all through nature: that you
can only recognise that to which you can respond. It is
true of the outer nature and our physical eyes. We
can only see each other because in the retina of the eye
there is the ether that answers to the external waves of
light. Similarly in moral characteristics, and, above all,
in the spiritual nature, we can only recognise in proportion
as we reproduce. If in ourselves there is some
opening up of the spiritual nature, if in ourselves there
are some of the qualities which shine out so gloriously
in Him, if in us there is some touch of that nature which
in Him has risen to divinity, ah! then it is possible that
we may throb responsive to Him when He comes, hidden,
as He ever has been, beneath the veil of flesh. But
that that may be so we must go outside the thought of
our time to that of the time that is coming; not the combativeness
of the fifth, but the compassion of the sixth
sub-race must find its home in our hearts. And if one
may judge from the past, when He comes He may
again be despised and rejected of men, for the spiritual
ideal is not an ideal to which the heart of our own age
quickly responds. You can see it in the characteristics of
the Christ: “when He was reviled He reviled not again;
when He suffered He threatened not.” But amongst you
that would show great poverty of spirit. Not to revile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
back when you are reviled, in the mind of the modern
day, is to mark the reviling as true. That is the spirit of
the time. If you are slandered, libelled, abused, go into
court and drag the slanderer there; if not, you are guilty.
That is the common opinion of the time. One who has
learned the lesson of the Christ, who before His accusers
answered nothing, that man is condemned by the popular
mind of the day. He would answer if he could, because
they would answer if they could; but the measure of the
Christ is not the measure of those who bear His name
in the combative civilisation of the time. And so when
He comes again, reviled and slandered as He must be if
He be far beyond our knowledge and our understanding,
the common verdict will go against Him as it went
against Him before. We may not murder; that is too
merciful in these modern days. We prefer rather that
the victim shall live to be tortured than to give him the
mercy of a swift, a ready death.</p>

<p>And so, looking over the world at the moment, there
seems little likelihood that when He comes He will be
welcome. A few will recognise Him as they ever have
done, and maybe, as the characteristics of the coming
race are those of spirituality, there will be more to welcome
Him, for the spiritual life is spreading to-day, and
those who are of the Spirit will know the law of the
Spirit; and I would fain leave you with the thought to-night
that that is a truth, that the Supreme Teacher will
again ere very long be incarnate upon earth, again made
manifest as Teacher, again walking and living amongst
us as last He walked in Palestine. Splendid as is the
hope, mighty as is the inspiration, there is nothing too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
glorious to be possible for the ever-unfolding Spirit in
man, and the hope of to-day is that that spirit is spreading,
despite the characteristics of our time; that men
are becoming more liberal, more tolerant, more ready to
recognise that which is true and just. And it may well
be that we have reached such a time of evolution that
the popular mind of the day will be transcended by large
numbers of the more spiritually minded, and that when
He comes again He will be able to stay amongst us more
than the three brief years that marked His last ministry.
That, then, is the word, the thought I leave with
you: to develop in yourselves the Spirit of the Christ,
and then at His coming you shall recognise His beauty.
Learn compassion, learn tenderness, learn good thoughts
of others rather than evil, learn to be tender with the
weak, learn to be reverent to the great; and if you can
develop those qualities in you, then the coming Christ
may be able to number you among His disciples, and the
welcome that the earth shall give Him shall not again
be a cross.</p>

<h3 id="I_Lecture_VII">Lecture VII<br />
<span class="smaller">The Larger Consciousness and
its Value</span></h3>

<p>Friends: During the whole of the lectures, of which
the discourse of to-night is the last, I have taken for
granted the existence of a larger consciousness in man
than that which we know at the present time as our
physical or waking consciousness. Over and over again
I have had occasion to allude to it, once or twice I dwelt
for a few moments upon it, but I could not interrupt the
course of what I had been putting to you by any detailed
description of the larger consciousness, or of the instruments
of that consciousness, the body or bodies of man.
It seemed to me that the work I had been trying to do
would remain somewhat imperfect unless I tried to place
before you, ere quitting the subjects I had been dealing
with, something with regard to this larger consciousness
in man; a consciousness which exists in every one of us;
which functions intermittently in all of us; which is in
course of unfolding in humanity at the present time.
And side by side with the unfolding of the consciousness
there goes a continual evolution of the bodies in which
that consciousness expresses itself, and it is that subject
that I want to deal with to-night, trying to put before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
you clearly and definitely the theory which is studied by
Theosophists with regard to this matter, a theory which
some of us have proved to be true by our own investigations,
and—which is a far more important thing—confirmed
by the great Scriptures of the world’s religions,
the testimony which has been given to man by seers, by
prophets of the highest, the most inspired, order. Sometimes
we are inclined to lay more stress on contemporary
evidence than on the evidence that comes from the great
Scriptures of the world. It seems to me as though that
were a little along the line of hiding the sun by holding a
plate quite close to the eyes. For it is quite clear, when
you come to think of it, that testimony which may be
given nowadays by half-developed students cannot in the
nature of things be nearly as valuable as that of the
great prophets and seers of humanity, embodied, however
mystically and allegorically, in the great Bibles of
humanity. In fact, the testimony of the modern-day
investigator should be checked and governed by those
mightier and wider revelations, and it is always a point
of satisfaction, a point of confirmation to the modern and
partially developed seer when he finds that his own
investigations throw light on some of the statements of
these Scriptures, and that the Bibles of the race become
more illuminating in some of their obscurer passages by
the light that he may have been able to gain by his own
investigations. I am not, then, pretending for one moment
that anything I put to you now is comparable in
value with what you might find out for yourselves, if
spiritually illuminated, in these great Bibles of religions.
But I do think that the investigations of to-day help us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to understand those great revelations, though much that
is there said is necessarily obscure to us because of the
immense difference in knowledge between the speaker
and the student; therefore, though we may call our
knowledge to-day a farthing light, it may be of value in
the deciphering of these great manuscripts of the past,
so that even a little knowledge of our own may enable us
to go more deeply into those great wells of truth which
have come down to us from antiquity, which have been
given to us by the Saviours of the world.</p>

<p>In order to make what I have to say clear to you, I
shall have to ask you to pardon me if I go in the beginning
a little into definition and detail. If you want to
study your own body, comparatively simple as that is,
you must be willing to learn the difference between a
bone and a nerve, between an artery and a vein, and so
on through the whole of the more or less familiar terms
which the physiologist uses in explaining the anatomy
and the physiology of the body. No person can have
clear and definite ideas if he is not willing to study the
mere nomenclature of that which he wishes to understand;
and while it is quite possible to avoid using words
of other languages, it is not possible to avoid some demand
on the consecutive thought-power of the student
if he desires to be anything more than a mere superficial
hearer, without any definite understanding of the subjects
which he supposes himself to be studying. There is
a very good and simple description of man’s constitution
in one of the Pauline epistles, where a triple division is
given, and a perfectly accurate division, although subdivisions
again are possible and practicable; but for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
purposes now that division into three, and then certain
subdivisions of each, will be sufficient to give you a very
clear and definite idea of consciousness in man; and then
by your own experience you can decide how much of the
larger consciousness comes into your waking consciousness,
or how much of you is still without vehicle of
expression, still without the power of manifesting in
worlds related to our own.</p>

<p>That division, as all of you will at once know, is Spirit,
Soul, Body. It is curious how indefinite the mass of
Christian people are with regard to the meaning of the
first two terms, Spirit and Soul. I am not quarreling
with the fact that different definitions may sometimes
be given; I am quarrelling with the fact that most
Christians have no definition at all; that they use the
words interchangeably; that they constantly talk of man
as a duality, always using the word body; sometimes
using the word Spirit, and sometimes soul, for all that
which they exclude from the body. Thus you hear
people talking about spirits manifesting in various ways;
sometimes you hear about the human soul and its immortality,
and so on. But a clear, distinct definition of
what is Spirit, what is soul—that for the most part is
wanting among even the students of theology. Let us
see if it be not possible to define them in a way which
may at least be clear. You may, of course, differ with
the division for the reason that you may think some
other dividing line is better; I am concerned chiefly, for
the moment, with giving you a clear definition, and then
you may correct or amend it according to your own
thought or your own knowledge. The definition will, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
course, govern me in all that I say to-night. First of
all, then: What is Spirit? Spirit is a germ of Divinity
unfolding itself gradually in human evolution, appropriating
certain kinds of matter which it gradually organises
into an instrument for self-expression—we may shorten
that by saying a germ of Divinity encased in matter.
That germ of Divinity, as you might naturally expect,
shows out in itself the triple division of its Divine parent.
Just as you find God, manifesting in a universe, ever
manifesting three supreme attributes, sometimes personified
into what is called a Trinity, so you would naturally
expect to find in the germ that which you find in the
parent—that the triple nature of Divinity should show
itself out in the triple nature of the Spirit which is man.
And that is so. You find Spirit showing itself forth in
full Divinity, taking for a moment the Christian names
as most familiar, in the form of Power in the Father, in
the form of Wisdom in the Son, in the form of creative
Activity in the Holy Spirit. If you will take those
names for the time as being most familiar to your own
thought, and therefore introducing nothing of difficulty
to you—if you will remember those accepted ideas for
the time, and translate them into terms of consciousness,
limited, because these are not all fully unfolded in man,
you will be able readily to distinguish in man’s spiritual
nature, and even more distinctly for the moment in the
lower reflexion of that with which I will deal presently—you
will be able to distinguish the threefold division,
and so to obtain, as it were, a clear picture of your own
spiritual nature. That which in Divinity we call Power,
the Will by which the worlds exist, shows itself out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
our own spiritual nature as Will. The Wisdom which
upholds the worlds shows itself out in the human Spirit
also as the pure and compassionate Reason, which is
the Wisdom, the Christ, in man. The third, creative
Activity, shows itself in intellect, the highest, the noblest
form of creative Activity—the intellect, the pure intellect
in man is the third reflexion in man of the creative
Activity of God. And if you link what may be less
familiar with the familiar, it will be very easy for you to
keep the thread of that which I desire to put before you.
Think first of all, then, that the Spirit, the germ of
Divinity in man, has to show out in the gradual unfolding
of its hidden powers these three supreme attributes
with which you are familiar in the thought of Divinity
itself.</p>

<p>Then, passing from that highest part of our nature to
what S. Paul calls the soul, what is the Soul in relation
to the Spirit? It is the temporary reflexion in grosser
matter of the eternal Spirit; the image of that which is
the eternal object; the reflexion in the mirror of a world
of that eternal life which passes from world to world,
unfolding, but is never subject to the transitoriness which
marks the ever-changing worlds. The soul in man is
the Spirit working in grosser matter; and hence in our
own natures, so familiar to us—for now we come into a
region that psychological science deals with and tries to
define and understand—we have, when we look at our
own consciousness, the soul, the reflexion of the Spirit in
grosser matter. We have the mind reflecting the pure
intellect with all its activities—imagination, judgement,
reason—all these powers of the mind. Then we find a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
part of our nature that we call the emotional; there we
have the reflexion of that pure and compassionate Wisdom
that I spoke of which shows itself in the lower
worlds by Love, the highest and loftiest of the emotions,
the root whence all virtues spring. For the same principle
of unity which expresses itself as Wisdom in the
spiritual world expresses itself as Love, which draws the
separated lives together in the world where matter has
overcome Spirit, where Spirit is blinded by matter. The
unity that the Spirit knows the soul seeks by Love, which
is the attribute that draws toward unity, and that which
in the spiritual world is known, in the lower world is
sought by this exquisite attribute of the soul. And that
which in the higher world we call Will becomes Desire
in the lower. For the difference between Will and Desire
is that Will is self-determined, whereas Desire is
determined by the attractiveness of objects outside the
consciousness. You are moved by Desire when some
pleasure attracts you, some pain repels you, when your
activity goes along the road that is determined by an
outer attraction, an outer repulsion; you are moved by
Will, the spiritual attribute, when the whole of your
inner nature, drawn up to a single point, self-determined,
sends that nature along the road that within yourself you
have chosen, whether it leads to pleasure or pain,
whether it leads to gain or loss in the lower world. Will
is determined from the spiritual Self; Desire is guided
and stimulated by objects in the lower world. Hence
that which is Will in the Spirit is Desire in the soul.
And so you find the soul represented by these three well-known
attributes: Mind, with all its powers; Emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the root emotion being love; Desire, the reflexion of the
determining power in this lower world.</p>

<p>When you come down into everyday life you find the
whole of these make up your waking consciousness,
showing itself out in the denser matter of the brain; in
your waking consciousness you know the working of the
mind; in your waking consciousness you know the
working of the emotions; in your waking consciousness
you know the working of desire; so that the waking consciousness,
the limited, the conditioned, the smaller
consciousness, is that which is within the limitations of
your brain or physical body, but is none other than the
larger consciousness which shows itself in the subtler
worlds as soul, in the spiritual world as Spirit. If you
realise clearly that outlining, with its subdivisions, you
will find that consciousness is a unit, and the differences
are differences of the material in which it is working
rather than in itself. The triple division is the only one,
whether you look at it in the brain, in the subtle body, in
the matter of the world where the Spirit rules. Everywhere
consciousness is one, expressing itself in three
modes, by three qualities, but everywhere a unit, yourself,
the reality within you.</p>

<p>What is Body? For there is a third factor in S.
Paul’s definition of man. Naturally the body also has
in it the same triple differentiation as the consciousness.
And so we find a spiritual body, the clothing of the
Spirit in the highest worlds of consciousness. We find
also what S. Paul, again, calls a natural body. There is
a natural body, he says, and there is a spiritual body.
But that natural body divides itself into two—the subtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
body in which the soul is working; the dense body in
which the waking consciousness is working, the reflexion
of the highest. Those two naturally go together, and
might well be classed roughly as the single natural body,
for it is transitory, impermanent, belongs to the three
worlds of change—the physical world, the intermediate,
and the heavenly; has a certain life through which it
passes in the three worlds, and then gives back its
elements to the worlds to which they respectively belong.
Whereas the spiritual body is a relatively permanent
thing, lasts through the whole of the long life of the
individual, passes through birth after birth, death after
death, knows neither birth nor death in its own nature,
passes through them, but is not affected by them—the
spiritual individuality, the real man, is eternal in his own
nature, and has a permanent clothing of the matter of
the spiritual world, unfolding his powers, organising his
matter, but remaining ever the same in essence, the
consciousness ever living in those worlds, the matter the
same, only becoming more and more definitely organised.
In that spiritual body remains the memory of all
the experiences through which you have passed; in that
spiritual body resides your true individuality, that knows
neither birth nor death; in that spiritual body which is
ever yours all the experiences of the past are gathered
up, and part of those experiences is put forth, birth after
birth, in order that the soul may clothe itself in new
bodies for new experiences and new developments. So
that the part of you that lasts is the Spirit in the spiritual
body; the part of you that changes, the soul in the temporary
body, whether you take the subtler or the denser
parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Supposing you accept that definition of man in his
triple division, it will be easy enough then to follow out
step by step what the higher consciousness is as apart
from the lower, the larger as apart from the smaller.
You will start with the great conception of a living Spirit
coming down into denser and denser matter, with the
object of acquiring that matter and subduing it to his
own purposes, appropriating it, wrapping himself up in
it, and temporarily blinded by the veil, but a veil that he
is going to turn into an instrument, so that by it he may
know all the worlds, and come into contact with every
portion of the universe. For that he appropriates the
matter of every world; for that he wraps himself round
in these material garments; and working upon these, he
turns them to his own purposes, shapes them by his own
will, moulds them in order that he may use them for
that which he desires to effect—contact with matter, the
condition of his becoming master of the worlds; and by
making matter his servant and his instrument, all the
worlds become open before him, and he can function in
any one of them. That the pure spiritual being cannot
do. He can only function in worlds of the Spirit, those
lofty eternal regions where Divinity itself resides and
manifests without the blinding effect of the denser matter
that we wear. But just as Divinity emanates these
coarser forms of matter in order that the spiritual germs
may be sown therein, and therein gain the experience by
which their powers will be unfolded from within; just as
Deity is manifest in matter, so must the germs of Deity
grow therein, until matter is subject to them as it is to
the Father of light, whence they come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>So, in looking at this consciousness unfolding and these
bodies becoming organised, we can trace throughout the
purpose of that long unfolding—to make the Spirit
master of matter, to enable him to act in every world;
and when we catch a glimpse of that great purpose, we
realise how perfect is the plan, how complete our triumph
will be. First we notice, when we are looking at the
lower forms of consciousness in ourselves, that we can
understand a certain relation between matter and Spirit
which we are told exists all the way up to the highest
spiritual world. And so far as investigation has been
carried by the students of to-day, they find that relation
in each successive world that they enter and
finally subdue. It is a relation, then, that runs right
through between consciousness and form, between Spirit
and matter; it is this: that every change in consciousness
has a corresponding vibration in matter, and that
every vibration in matter has a corresponding change in
consciousness. We are told that that relation is imposed
by the Logos Himself in His first shaping of the matter
side of His universe; that all the vibrations of which He
makes the atoms capable answer one by one to changes
in His own consciousness, and that throughout the whole
of His universe, in all the mighty realm of spirit-matter
that He rules, this correspondence is universally, unchangeably
found—for every change in consciousness a
corresponding change in vibration, for every change in
vibration a corresponding change in consciousness.</p>

<p>Let us see how that would work if anyone whose eyes
are a little opened looks at the aura of a person—the
lowest part of that aura, if you will, in etheric or astral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
matter: let us say, astral. You will notice a large number
of colours continually flashing through it and changing;
and if you examine those colours, every one, as you
know from your ordinary study, representing a certain
definite vibration in matter—every colour is nothing
more than a certain vibration in matter, a vibration
with a definite wave-length—if you watch those changing
colours in the aura you will find that they are either
generated by a state of consciousness or give rise to it.
Suppose, for instance, you find a person in a mood of
devotion, engaged perhaps in prayer—you can see them
by the score in any Christian church. Watch the astral
aura of that person, and you will find that the whole of
it is vibrating in a way that gives you the colour of
blue, blue everywhere predominating, the whole of the
aura suffused with that colour. But you will also find,
if there is in that congregation a quiet person who
was not feeling devotional when he came into that congregation,
that gradually his astral body will be affected
by the vibrations in the astral bodies near him, and
that those vibrations imposed upon him from without
will produce a devotional mood within him. You can
start it, then, at either end: either the mood producing
the appearance, the vibration, or the vibration producing
the mood. Take it in another form: have you never
felt when you yourself were perfectly good-tempered
and some very irritable person came up to you, have
you never felt that you yourself were becoming irritable?—not
that you had anything to be irritable about,
but merely because the other man was, and it needs
considerable control, control over the astral body, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
prevent the irritation of the person who comes near
you from affecting your own previously placid mood.
If you have not observed this, keep watch over yourself
during the coming week, and you will find how continually
you reproduce the emotions of the people with whom
you come into contact. What is the mechanism of it?
Very simple. That person’s astral body is vibrating in
consonance with the emotion he is feeling. Those vibrations
of his astral body set up vibrations in your astral
body, a perfectly mechanical thing. But because it is
your astral body, the matter you have appropriated,
those vibrations in it produce in you the corresponding
mood of irritation. Hence the common ethical precept
given by every great teacher, to return good for evil.
That is by a deliberate effort of the consciousness to
throw yourself into the mood which is opposite to the
evil mood of the person with whom you come into contact.
If you do that, then your own mood will overbear
in your astral body the vibrations imposed upon it from
without, and your astral body will begin to vibrate in
correspondence with your own good emotion instead of
with the evil emotion imposed from outside. The further
result of that, if you be strong enough, will be to
correct the bad vibration in the astral body of the man
who is near you, and so, by correcting that vibration
into harmony with your own, to produce in him your
own good emotion, instead of having your emotion controlled
by his. That is the ordinary science of the emotions
that every aspirant for the higher life is set to
practise in his daily life. He is first told the theory,
so that he may understand what he is doing, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
he is set to the practise, so that by the practise he may
realise the truth of the law that his teacher has explained.
Sometimes the ethical teacher only says: “Love
your enemies, do good to them that hate you.” With
the unspiritual hearer the question will very readily
arise, “Why should I give love when hatred is given to
me?” Only knowledge will enable you to understand
the wisdom that underlies this precept of all the great
teachers of the past. Speaking in an age when authority
was valid, and when people were willing to accept the
precept from one whom they recognised as greater than
themselves, they only proclaimed the law, and the docile
hearer tried to obey. In our own more critical and
combative age it is necessary to justify wisdom to a
more critical and carping generation, and so the full
explanation is given which shows you the scientific truth
which underlies the ethical precept.</p>

<p>That runs through the whole of the working of our
bodies, the whole of the changes in our consciousness.
You can work it out step by step, or you can read the
working out which has been made by a thoughtful student,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and so you will have a veritable science of the
emotions, and you will go out into the world a source
of peace, a source of blessing, a source of all good
emotions, helping the weaker by your own knowledge
and your own strength, and so enabling them to climb
more quickly by giving this helping hand out of the
knowledge that you have learned.</p>

<p>By that fact, then, we have power over matter, we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
throw it into the vibrations we desire. We can do more
than that: we can shape it into organs of expression for
the consciousness that is unfolded within us. Understanding
these laws, we begin to realise that by these
bodies we may come into touch with the various worlds
around us. Let us see, again, the method. When first
the spiritual germ descends into matter, gathering round
itself the matter that it needs, that matter is like a mere
cloud. It is still so in the highest regions for most; it
is becoming organised into definite instruments of
consciousness in the three lower worlds in all the more
advanced members of our present race, to a very large
extent in all of you. If you pause for a moment on the
physical body, you will see exactly what is meant by the
phrase: the organising of the body. You have here
now in your physical body a valuable instrument, first
for acquiring knowledge of the outer world, and then for
acting on that world, carrying out the knowledge you
have gained. You have, as you know, in your body two
sets of nerves, called sensory and motor: by the sensory
you gather knowledge from without; by the motor you
act upon the outer world, utilising the knowledge you
have gathered to bring about the results that you desire;
and your physical body is well organised for its work.
By the evolution of the senses, by the gradual growth of
the whole nervous system, by the development of your
brains, you have largely become master of this densest
world, the physical world, to which your body is related.
All that is needed further is a comparatively small
evolution—the development of the other two senses, the
conquest of the realm of ether, that which science is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
now investigating. So far, then, you have one instrument,
the instrument of your waking consciousness.
Through that, spirit and soul alike are working, the powers
of the soul showing out as far as the density of the
matter will permit. Coming into denser matter is very
much the same as if you brought a light through thicker
and thicker glass. The light would remain the light, but
that which would show out through the glass would be
less and less according to the opacity of that glass. So
with the light of the spirit shining through the soul and
the body. Your next work is the organisation of the
next finer body of matter, that which I called the subtle.
In that your emotions are working, in that your thoughts
are working, and to a very large extent your mental and
emotional bodies—we call the emotional the astral—are
organised at the present time. But here more variety
comes in. Some of you will have your astral body so
well developed that it is fit for separate working in the
intermediate world. Some of you will have it well
developed so far as consciousness is concerned, but not
so far as the reception of impressions from the outer
intermediate world. That is, your consciousness will be
working there in that finer matter that has not yet
sufficiently organised the astral body to receive impressions
from without.</p>

<p>Gradually, as evolution goes on the organisation of
the astral body will go on in everybody, but it is possible,
as I suggested to you a few Sundays ago, very largely
to quicken that evolution, and gradually to make the
astral body what it ought to be, as perfect an instrument
for contact with the astral world as the physical body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
is for contact with the physical world. That is, of
course, what a very considerable number of people have
done, and they are able to act either in or out of the
physical body. We will take both cases in a moment.
Take the finer part first of the subtle body—the
mental body. In most of you that also is fairly organised,
but, again, it is organised for working within
yourself, but not receiving from the outer mental world
all that hereafter it will be able to receive and utilise,
and only a few of you, comparatively, would be able to
leave the denser and the astral body behind, and live in
the heavenly world, in full consciousness, working there
as thoroughly as you can work in the physical world.</p>

<p>What signs are there by which you can judge how far
the organisation of the astral and the mental bodies is
going on, so that if you work to quicken their organisation
you will be able partly to judge how far your work
is effective? Let us take the working in the body, the
physical body, first. As these other higher forms of
consciousness begin to become co-ordinated with the
physical, and to hand on to it the impressions that they
receive, the mental body is becoming highly organised;
when the person possessing it is strong in science,
physical science, above all in the grasping of principles,
in the power of observation, in the ability to draw conclusions
from the observations that have been made,
organisation is improving. Among the scientific men
of our own time that mental body will be very highly
developed, chiefly for use in the waking consciousness,
very imperfectly as yet for direct reception on the higher
planes. The higher development of the astral body will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
show itself in forms of art and of high emotion, and just
in proportion as those are transmissible to the waking
consciousness may you realise that the astral body is
becoming more definitely organised. When the body of
the intellect, the lasting body, part of the spiritual body,
is becoming organised, then it is that you find fine
metaphysical ability, great philosophical profundity of
thought, the highest conceptions of idealistic art, the
highest achievements in idealistic literature. Those are
the faculties that belong to the beginning of the spiritual
body in man, transcending the transitory, beginning to
shape the permanent instrument of the Spirit. Where
you have great talent, where the mental body is highly
organised, where you have the highest genius, there the
spiritual body is beginning its organisation. For that
highest genius is the flashing down from the organised
spiritual body into the lower nature of knowledge which
in those regions alone can be gained; and when art and
literature become illuminated by the Spirit, then you
have the mighty geniuses of history that outlast the
passing generations and shine out in the world of
thought.</p>

<p>What signs may we find other than those of the
organisation of these bodies through which the larger
consciousness will work? Genius is the highest of all,
save that which I spoke of as the manifestation of the
Christ, the Wisdom Spirit in man. But if we leave
those loftiest manifestations of the larger consciousness
alone, what signs may we find amongst ourselves of the
growing organisation of those higher bodies and the
unfolding of the larger consciousness? There are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
many signs to-day of the organising of the astral body,
and it is in the lack of discriminating these from genius
that we find a great absence in power in the new psychology.
You find the organisation of the astral body
showing itself forth in the power to receive impressions
directly from the astral plane, and the power to translate
them into the waking consciousness. In the body those
first signs are seen in telepathy where it is well developed,
where people are able to communicate with one
another without the ordinary physical means of communication,
and that is not so very infrequent a thing
among the more thoughtful of our own time. That is
a power you can develop, if you like, by definite and regular
practice; only remember that all development of
power means regular practice and patient and reiterated
experiment. One finds, for the most part, that after
a few weeks or months of practice people are apt to
drop the whole thing if they have not in that time
gained startling results. That is not the way that powers
grow. The law is sure, that if you choose to concentrate
your mind so as to make a clear image, that will
be reproduced in astral matter. Then by an effort of the
self-determined will you can send that astral thought-form
to whomsoever you choose; and if you practise
that day after day, week after week, nay, even month
after month and year after year, you will find that
you will ultimately develop the power of sending thought
clearly and definitely, so that you will be able to communicate
with the absent as surely, as certainly as any
physical-plane communication can be sure and certain.
Practice along these lines can do you nothing but good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
It increases the power of the will, it increases the concentration
of thought; but remember that without concentrated
thought and fairly strong will you are bound
to have a very long practice before you will have results
tangible in the outer world. The person who cannot
keep his mind steady for a couple of minutes at a time,
the person who cannot concentrate definitely on one
thought, such a person certainly cannot transfer that
which he is unable to create; and for a very considerable
time people will have to practise by creating the thought-image
before they will have anything to be definitely
sent to another. But that is one of the means of organising
the astral and the mental body as an instrument of
the larger consciousness. Some people, of course, have
it by nature, as you say, but what does that mean? Only
that they have practised it in previous life. No one gets
anything for nothing from nature. On the other hand,
nature is a good paymaster, and pays the exact wages
that we have earned, never withholding anything. If
you can do it easily, it is because you have done it before;
if you find it difficult, it is because you are beginning that
definite kind of work. But no one obtains it without
labour, no one can develop it without long and continued
practice. But there is one form in which the astral body
shows its organisation when you are out of the dense
body and not in it, in the form of dream. Whenever
you go to sleep you leave your dense body behind.
Some dreams belong only to the brain; it is because
people do not distinguish dream from dream that so
much foolish ridicule is sometimes cast on the dream-state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
altogether. It is perfectly true that there are
dreams which grow out of conditions of the physical
body, where a little change in the circulation, a momentary
block in some vessel of the brain, will cause a
dream, incoherent, senseless, without meaning or illumination.
That is the physical dream; it may be caused
by any disturbance of the body—indigestion, a hundred
other things. The dream that shows that the astral body
is becoming organised is a dream in which some definite
knowledge is conveyed, in which some definite warning
is given, in which something is added to you that you
had not before, or in which you come into contact with
someone who has passed out of the physical conditions
through the gateway of death, and whom you may meet
in the astral world when you yourself have temporarily
dropped the dense body. Those dreams are coherent,
rational, sometimes illuminative. Remember how many
dreams have now been put on record in which a man
has gained in the dream-state knowledge that he had not
in the waking state. How often that knowledge gained
in the dream-state has enabled him in the waking state
to cover over some gap that he was before unable to
bridge. You will find in Myers’ book on <cite>Human Personality</cite>
some of these dreams given, although not very
definitely explained, and if you find in your experience
that those are becoming more frequent, then you may be
sure that your astral body is becoming a vehicle of consciousness,
an instrument by which consciousness can
work in the other world. It is true that in some dreams,
especially of warning, the thought may be thrown into
your mind from without when you have not found it out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
for yourself, but have been informed of it by another.
Such a warning may come through, given you by some
friend, some helper, someone whom you love, who may
have passed onwards, and so has the advantage of the
astral vision. But in all those cases there comes into the
waking consciousness something from the larger, and as
you perfect the astral body all those come more and
more within your control. As it becomes organised there
is less and less need to leave it in order to exercise its
powers. You will find yourself seeing, hearing, while
the physical senses are active, while the consciousness is
working normally, the waking consciousness in the brain;
so that slowly and gradually you will unify the physical
and the astral bodies and live in the two worlds continuously
at one and the same time, finding those worlds
intermingling and interworking; and so you will gain
that much of the larger consciousness which belongs
to the expression of the soul through the subtle astral
body.</p>

<p>Exactly on the same lines with the heavenly worlds,
the mental world, your evolution will go on, and for this
there is one condition regarding the consciousness, there
is one condition regarding the instrument for the unfolding
of consciousness—regular and steady meditation.
There is no other way. If you find anybody telling
you that by any physical means you can really unfold
your consciousness, tell them that they do not realise
what they are talking about. You can start a little astral
consciousness on the lowest parts of the astral world by
causing vibrations in matter in the physical that affect
the astral, and so bring about a change in consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in that lowest part of the astral world, but you can go
no further. I have seen in India men who, by the use of
difficult physical means that none of you would care to
use—for they bring about the gradual spoiling of the
physical body—I have known them able to leave the
physical body and live for the time being in the astral,
but in that astral body they were unconscious, not conscious;
they were not coming into touch with the astral
world, nor using the larger consciousness at all. They
had only forced themselves into that world in the astral
body where it was not organised enough for the reception
of impressions, nor the consciousness unfolded to understand
them, and they had injured the physical brain
and rendered that practically useless for physical utility;
so that they had lost both worlds instead of gaining the
higher that they sought. When one has seen that happen
in India one realises that those methods are not
methods that it is desirable to spread in the West; and
it is along that line that so many of those pseudo-occult
books are going which come to us from America, promising
that if we follow those practices we shall be able to
get the better of other people in business transactions,
and hypnotise them for our own advantage and our own
gain. Wherever you find that the method of working
and that the object aimed at, be sure that you are dealing
with a form of unfolding and of evolution that can only
injure; it cannot really serve. The worst of it is that
those forms tend to atrophy the parts of the brain that
you want to bring things through after a higher consciousness
is active and the higher body is organised.
By this means you injure the brain, and with the brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the connecting link between this world and the next, so
that you injure yourself along that line as well as along
the other, and make yourself incapable, until you have a
new body, of that higher unfolding at which you aim.
There you have the danger of people picking up fragments
of an ancient science of the East, without realising
all the protection with which in the East that science is
surrounded; and if even there one finds occasionally
such cases as I have mentioned, of the ruined physical
frame and the undeveloped astral body, then how much
more dangerous it is when given to people of different
physical heredity, without the conditions which in the
East are ever imposed! Meditation, then, is the one
safe way of unfolding the consciousness, and thus organising
the vehicle; and the other condition is purity of
thought, purity of desire, purity of physical life. That is
the matter side of the training. Your thoughts must
be pure, otherwise your mental body will be unfit for
higher development; your desires must be pure, or your
astral body will not be fit for that unfolding at which
you aim; your physical body must be pure, otherwise
when the developed mental and astral pour down their
power on the physical, the physical will be unable to
answer, and you will have hysteria instead of the wider
consciousness you seek.</p>

<p>Those, roughly, then, are the conditions: meditation
for the consciousness, purity for the evolution of the
instrument. If you are willing to accept those conditions,
then the path of the higher evolution opens before
you, and according to your courage, your perseverance,
and your ability will be the rapidity with which you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
tread that path. The object before you should be the
helping of others, the gaining of these powers in order
that you may be more useful, not in order that you may
be greater than your fellow-men. Of the purity of your
motive there is only one test: are you using the powers
you have now for the helping of your race? If you are
not, then no profession that you will use the higher
powers for good will be effective in bringing you help in
their unfolding. I have met many a man, many a woman,
who is anxious to be an invisible helper—that is,
a worker on the astral plane—but I do not always find
that those people are visible helpers as far as their
present powers go. And I do not understand why people
should want to go about in astral slums when they keep
carefully away from the physical slums which are already
within their reach. So far as you can go by
your own power you have the right to go, but if you ask
for help from those more highly developed—from the
great Teachers of the race—then you have to bring in
your hands the proof—and that proof is life, and not
words—that as you are using well the talent you have
you deserve to be helped in the gaining of others. There
is the underlying meaning of those strange words ascribed
to the Christ, that he who has much, to him shall
be given. Those who have used well that which they
have, those alone have claim to be helped in gaining
more; for by their life they have shown that they do the
best with what they possess, and that is the guarantee
that with more they will utilise that also for the race.
And so in the old rules of discipleship it was said that
when the disciple came to the Teacher he must bring with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
him in his hands the fuel for the fire; it was the fire of
sacrifice, and the fuel was everything that the pupil possessed
in mind, body, and estate; and he brought that in
his hands as offering to the Teacher, and then alone was
he accepted by the one who knew. And so in these days
also that higher evolution, quickened by the power of the
great Ones, can only be opened up to those who bring in
their hands the fuel for the fire of sacrifice; you must be
willing to give up everything you have, and own nothing,
material or immaterial; you must hold everything you
have and everything you are at the service of the great
One from whom you ask the gift of knowledge. When
that is brought the gift is never refused; when that door
is thus knocked at it never remains closed. True it is
that the gateway is narrow; true it is, now as of old,
“Strait is the gate, narrow is the way, and few there be
that find it.” But the fewness does not depend on
the grudging of the Teacher—it depends on the want of
self-surrender by the disciple. Bring all you have and
all you are, lay it at the feet of the Master of the
Wisdom; He will open the gateway, He will guide you
along the path. But dream not that words are heard in
that high atmosphere where the Master lives and
breathes: only high thoughts can reach Him, only noble
acts can speak the thoughts you have conceived; for
voice there is the life that is lived, and only the life that
speaks of sacrifice can claim the teaching at His hands.</p>

<span class="smaller">The Place of Theosophy in the
Coming Civilisation</span></h3>

<p class="lecture"><i>A Public Lecture delivered in
the Queen’s Hall, London, at the British Convention,
July 2nd, 1909.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been my lot now for many years to visit England
either every year or every other year, in order to try to
spread throughout the country the truths of the ancient
wisdom which in these days we call by its Greek name
of Theosophy. This year it has been my special duty to
place on record in the capital of the empire a certain
line of teaching with regard to the changing conditions
of the times, to draw the attention of the thoughtful to
the signs all around us of a changing civilisation—signs
of an age that is passing—signs of a dawning civilisation
that may be seen on the far horizon of our day. And I
had thought that I should only reach as to this the few
thousands that may be gathered together Sunday after
Sunday in a London hall, but by the generous kindness
of the <cite>Christian Commonwealth</cite> these lectures have been
spread far and wide. To-night I am taking up something
of the thought that there has been more fully expressed,
with the special intention of showing you the part that
Theosophy will play in that coming civilisation, the nature
of the work that it is doing in preparation for the
civilisation on the threshold. I have worked out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
those lectures in some detail what here I must only state,
that just as you can find in watching the evolution of
a man that at different ages of his life he is dominated by
different parts, as we may say, of his consciousness—as
we find emotion dominating him in youth, mind dominating
him in his maturity, the wisdom of the Spirit in his
age—so we may see, in glancing abroad over the civilisations
and the races of men, that a similar succession
may be observed, and that hence an indication of the future
may be obtained. For we can see in the race that
preceded our own, and still is living and active, the great
Keltic race, how high emotion is the dominant note, and
how the expression of that emotion finds itself best in
poetry and in art. We can see that in the Teutonic race
intellect is the dominant note, and that mind in all the
spheres of its triumph shows itself out among the peoples
who grow from that stock, of which our own nation
is a branch. That being of the past and the present, it is
not irrational to look now in the unfolding humanity for
the growth of the next principle, the next mark in the
opening consciousness, the development of the spiritual
nature in man, which succeeds the intellectual as inevitably
as that succeeds the emotional, and places the
crown of wisdom and all-embracing love on the brow of
the humanity which has passed through youth, is passing
through its manhood, is going onwards to the full maturity
of its evolution. So in the coming civilisation
we shall expect to find spirituality the prevailing mark,
dominating religion, dominating science, art, and society,
and we may rationally look, as spirituality grows, and
shapes and moulds the coming civilisation, that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
sphere of religion we shall see ever-increasing unity; in
the sphere of science we shall find new methods of
investigation, new powers to use in thought; that in the
sphere of mind we shall find nobler ideals, more inspiring
power; and in society we shall find spirituality showing
itself, laying the foundation of society in self-sacrifice,
building it up by self-control, and marking Brotherhood
as its ultimate goal and achievement.</p>

<p>Such, very roughly, are the signs that we think will
mark the coming civilisation. What has Theosophy to do
with that civilisation: what its place, its part, its duty?
That is the question that I am to try to answer to-night.
And fairly the questions might be asked in speaking of
Theosophy by those who know little of it save the name—and
how little of it is known we can often see in the
allusions we find to it in our daily Press—naturally the
questions might arise: What is Theosophy? Whence
does it come? Briefly, those preliminary questions, then,
should be answered. Theosophy, in the first place, as its
name implies, is the declaration that man as a spiritual
being can directly know God who is Spirit. It is the proclamation
of the ancient Gnosis as against the agnosticism
of the closing years of the nineteenth century.
Secondly, it is a body of doctrines which are common
to all the great religions of the world; doctrines which
we find explained, more or less perfectly and fully, in
every great religion of the past as well as in every great
religion of the present; a collection of teachings, spiritual
in their nature, universal in their spread, endeavouring
to guide man along the way to perfection,
training him in life, illuminating him in the hour of death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
It does not deal with any special rites, any special ceremonies,
any special part of the teaching of religion which
is not universal, which is not everywhere to be found.
So far as those are concerned, the specialties of every
religion, it studies them, it explains them, it shows the
occult meanings which often lie behind the outer garment
of ceremony, behind the ordinary rites of worship,
behind the symbols that you find in every faith; but
while it explains them, illuminates them, enforces their
real value, it does not strive to persuade people to adopt
one religion rather than another, but, instead of giving
up their own religion for another, it counsels them to
find in that religion the deep truths that all faiths have
in common. Hence it endeavours, where religion is concerned,
to bring peace instead of war, to make religion a
healer rather than a divider, a peacemaker rather than a
battle-cry among men. And in searching out these essentials
of every religion, and drawing these out and
setting them before the minds of men, it justifies its
claim to its name of the Ancient Wisdom, of that Divine
Wisdom in which all the great religions have their root.</p>

<p>Such, very roughly and briefly again, is Theosophy in
its essence: a Gnosis as regards the relation of man to
God, a statement of fundamental spiritual truths common
to the great religions of the world. In a moment,
in dealing with its work in the religion of the future, I
will mention those doctrines one by one, so that you
may see for yourselves how they may be traced in all
the scriptures, living and dead, and in all the religions
of the world. I put first the blunt statement of what
Theosophy is, in order, if possible, to clear away the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
clouds which ignorance and prejudice have spread
around it.</p>

<p>Taking it, then, that the coming civilisation is to be
spiritual, that this Theosophy is to have a definite place
and work therein, let me try to point out to you the
nature of the work, the lines along which Theosophy
labours to prepare the way for, as well as to influence,
that coming civilisation for which we look; and when I
say to prepare the way for, it is because we believe that
every great religion has a civilisation attached to it, and
according to the nature of the religion the civilisation
that it moulds will be; and because we also believe that
at the beginning of every civilisation a great Teacher
appears in the world to give the impulse to that civilisation
and to shape the religion that will mould it. Hence,
with our looking for a coming civilisation, we look also
for the manifestation of a great, a divine Teacher.</p>

<p>But I said, people might ask not only what is
Theosophy, but—Whence does it come? It is the latest—I
do not say the last—of the great impulses which, one
after another, in the long past of history, have founded
the great religions of the world. Those impulses ever
come from a mighty Brotherhood of Teachers made up
of the past Founders of religion, presided over by the
Supreme Teacher who rules and guides and inspires
them all—a mighty Brotherhood of Teachers of the
world, coming from time to time to found a religion, to
shape a civilisation. Such impulses were often repeated
in the past, to be again repeated in the century which
now is running its course amongst us, history in very
truth repeating itself, and bringing at the appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
time a new civilisation, preceded by a new spiritual
impulse.</p>

<p>That impulse on this occasion has differed from all
that went before it in that it founds no new religion,
builds no new barrier, does not mark out believers and
unbelievers, does not try to proselytise, but only to
inspire. For, as I just said, Theosophy goes to all religions
as a peacemaker, and does not strive to draw
away from any faith those whom the law has brought to
birth beneath its shelter. So its first work in preparation
for the coming civilisation is to try to bring about a
brotherhood of religions, not destroying any, not trying
to make any less potent than they were before, but endeavouring
to transform them from rivals to brothers,
so that each religion may recognise its kinship with other
religions, and they may become one mighty family,
instead of warring and separate creeds. Now, to that
high end it brings the knowledge of facts which have
largely been used against religion, but ought really to be
used in its service. Those of you who have reached
even middle age will remember how in the latter part of
the nineteenth century there grew up among the sciences
of the time a science which was named Comparative
Mythology. You will remember how that science grew;
the oldest among you may remember its very beginnings.
It sought out of the past religions, as well as out of the
present religions, to prove that religion grew up out of
ignorance, and only became refined as it grew older and
spread among more cultivated people. It used the
researches of the archæologist, the discoveries of the
antiquarian, as weapons against the religion which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
dominated Christendom, where science was most powerful
and most active. It took up doctrine after doctrine
of the Christian faith, and pointed to the existence of
those doctrines in other times, in other civilisations,
among the religions of the past, both living and dead.
It brought information from the open tombs of Egypt,
and gathered together the fragments of Egyptian knowledge
as they were traced on the papyrus, on the leaf
that was put on the bosom of the mummy. It gathered
them together, and out of those scattered fragments it
made what we know well as the Egyptian <cite>Book of the
Dead</cite>. It did the same with Chaldæa, the same with
Nineveh, the same with those replicas of Egyptian
temples that were unburied in far-off Mexico—temples
thousands of years older than the Aztecs, who slew their
worshippers and destroyed their civilisation, the Aztecs,
who themselves were thousands of years old when
Cortez and his Spaniards treated them as they had
treated their forerunners. It brought from those unburied
temples similar teachings and similar ideas. It
gathered, again, similar teachings from the books of
China, with its immemorial traditions; from the scriptures
of India, from the fragments of the Zoroastrian
tradition, from the books of the Buddhist nations, from
Greek and Roman. Piling up all the evidence it had
gathered, it made out of that the science of Comparative
Mythology. It was the deadliest weapon that was ever
forged against dogmatic Christianity, because founded
on knowledge of facts that none could deny. Then it was
that it became the duty of Theosophy, just then born into
the world, to come forward to acknowledge the truth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the facts, and to add many others to the store, but to
point out that instead of Comparative Mythology there
should be built a science of Comparative Religion, showing
that that which had been universally taught was
truth, and not lies; was verity, and not delusion. It defended
every religion by the universality of religious beliefs;
and it pointed out that a truth did not cease to be
a truth because it was ancient, did not cease to be a truth
because it ruled in ancient times as well as now; it justified
religion by the very arguments that were used to
discredit it, and traced it to a universal Ancient Wisdom,
instead of to the ignorance of the savage, refined in modern
days. It brought to that contention many an argument
on which I have not time to dwell, but that you can
very easily read for yourselves, if it be unknown to you,
in the many publications that have been written along
these lines. And now, in order to utilise that for the
coming time in the building of the Brotherhood of Religions,
we proclaim in every country, to every faith,
among the people of every religion, the common heritage,
the spiritual verity, the primary doctrines that are found
in every faith. What are they? They are but few, although
far-reaching. They could be counted on the fingers
of two hands, and even than that, so few are they.</p>

<p>The first great doctrine that every religion teaches is
the unity of God; the second, that God in manifestation
is ever triple. In philosophy they speak of three qualities
or attributes; in religion they mostly personify, and
speak of a Trinity or a triple form. But whether philosophical,
or personified in religion, you have ever Power
or Will, Wisdom, Activity, and you can find those in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Trinity of every nation, whether you take in the Christian
creed the Father, the embodiment of Power, of Will,
the Son, the Wisdom everlasting; the Spirit, the creative
Activity by which the worlds are made. Or you might
take it equally well in Hindūism, and there you would
see the order reversed: the Creator, who is the embodiment
of Activity; the Preserver, the embodiment of
Wisdom; the Regenerator, the embodiment of Power.
And so might I take you to ancient and dead religions,
and to ancient and living religions, and show you ever
the same. For those primary truths of God are everywhere
proclaimed, one in His nature, triple in His
manifestation. And then, after those first two truths,
you come to the third: the vast family of the Sons of
God, the great hierarchy of spiritual intelligences—archangels,
angels, shining ones; call them what you will—that
mighty family of Sons of God, amongst which humanity
finds its own place in process of evolution. Then
you come to the fourth great teaching: that you have
the unfolding of consciousness going on continually, and
shaping ever finer and finer bodies for its own expression;
that which science calls evolution, but which religion
has ever called reincarnation, the method of perfecting
the germinal seed of divinity into the divine
man, when the human evolution is complete. Then,
fifthly, the worlds in which these changes go on: our
earth, the intermediate world, and the heavenly; and
man, with bodies of matter belonging to all the worlds,
so that he may be in contact with each. And then the
sixth great teaching of universal law—law in the world
of mind as well as in the world of matter; law which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
builds character as well as builds the outer world; law unchanging
and inviolable, which, because we can know,
we can utilise to the building up of ourselves into noblest
ideals. And then, closing these doctrines that are common
to every religion, we find the idea of the Teachers
who preside over human evolution, who inspire religions,
who guard the spiritual progress of mankind. Those are
the truths universal, those are the teachings which every
religion has had and has; and so we find in these religions,
by their unity of teaching, the reality of Brotherhood
that we seek everywhere to spread. For of what
avail to change from one faith to another if in the new
religion you only find the same old truths, though
ceremonies and rites may differ? And we see in this
Brotherhood of Religions one value to mankind which
one religion only could never have given to us. Just as
you see the light of the sun broken up into many colours,
and those colours giving all the beauty to earth which
you see in the nature around you; just as you know
that those colours that constitute white light can be recombined
again into the white light whence they sprung,
so is it with religions. The great truths, the great
virtues are as one—the great white light of truth; they
are broken up by the prism of the intellect, and the
many religions ray out, each with its own colour; they
are recombined by the prism of the Spirit, and once
again are blended into the unity of truth.</p>

<p>If you look at religions you will see how true that is.
Every religion has a note of its own, a colour of its own,
that it gives for the helping of the world. Go back to
ancient Egypt, and you find the note of the Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
religion is knowledge, so that Egyptian religion became
the mother of Egyptian science, and science spread from
Egypt westwards over Europe. Go to the Far East,
and you will find in India that the special note of
Hindūism is the all-pervading nature of Deity, and the
all-compelling duty which is the law for every individual.
Go to Persia in her ancient days, and there the note of
purity was struck—purity of thought, of word, of act.
Go to Greece, and you will find her note was beauty—beauty
in architecture, beauty in sculpture, beauty in
painting, beauty in the perfection of her philosophy,
which made the Beautiful of equal rank with the True
and the Good. And in Rome you find the note of law,
law all-compelling; and in Christianity the note of self-sacrifice,
which has in it the promise of the future; and
in Islām the proclamation again of the divine unity.
And so every religion with its own note, every religion
with its own colour; blended together they give the
whiteness of truth, blended together they give a mighty
chord of perfection.</p>

<p>Now that you could not have had with one faith and
one creed. Human thought is too narrow, human brain
cannot grasp at once this many-noted chord of perfection;
and so many religions, each with its own characteristic,
as though the Divine Name were to be spelt out by
the religions, and each gave a single letter, all the letters
together making the name of the Blessed One. When
you look on religion in that way you realise how mighty
a thing it is, how its strength is in unity expressed in
diversity; how each religion should learn from others
and share with others that which is its own specialty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
And surely that does not lower religion, but makes it
greater; surely it does not make it less compelling, but
more attractive. Is Christ less when He taught “Love
your enemies,” because we know that the Buddha said,
six hundred years before Him, “Hatred ceases not by
hatred at any time; hatred ceases by love”? Or is it
not more beautiful to see in the Buddha and the Christ
proclaimers of the one eternal law, coming at different
times to different nations, but ever with a single truth,
ever with one code to teach to men?</p>

<p>Now in trying to do this work—which, of course, is
taken in detail when one is dealing only with that side
of thought—Theosophy is preparing for that common
spiritual religion, the one Divine Wisdom, of which all
the religions of the world shall see themselves as
branches, while the trunk and root of truth are one.
That is the great work, then, in the coming civilisation,
which it is the duty of Theosophy to labour at; and
hence, in one of its early teachings, it was said it was to
be the corner-stone of the religion of humanity. For
the religion of humanity will be the Brotherhood of
Religions that I have been describing, where no religion
can be spared, for each has something special, but where
all religions will be seen as one, because they give similar
truths in different forms.</p>

<p>Let us pass from that, and ask what Theosophy is to
do in the coming civilisation, in the science of that time.
Science in the coming days will pass into subtler worlds,
or subtler matter. It has practically conquered the
grosser, denser forms of matter; it is now going onward
to the subtler and the finer. And there lies its difficulty:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
that the methods which did for the grosser, the apparatus
that measured the grosser, are not applicable for the
subtler. And when I say “the gross,” think how fine
even its apparatus is, for quite lately I had sent to me an
article in a scientific journal which spoke of an apparatus
that could measure the forty-millionth of an inch, and
yet that is coarse compared with the subtleties of the
matter that lies beyond that, which science must conquer
in the coming days. Now of what value can Theosophy
be there? It is bringing, by training, the possibility to
man in our modern days of quickening his own evolution,
and running ahead of the slow working of the laws of
nature unguided by human intelligence. It is bringing,
and proclaiming everywhere, a system by which man can
more rapidly unfold the powers of his consciousness,
and also may more rapidly develop the organs of finer
matter that are related to those worlds of finer matter
which science will soon enter and begin to conquer. It
is telling people how to develop the finer senses, and
showing them the line along which the very few have
gone in the past, but along which myriads shall tread in
the future, the next great stage of human evolution, the
organising of the finer body in man. It is bringing that
to the help of science in order that by the evolution of
the finer body the finer world may become the object of
observation, exactly on the same lines, exactly by the
same laws, that your grosser physical bodies to-day
enable you to investigate the grosser physical world
around you. There are eyes that are keener than these
organs evolved from the pigment spots of the medusa;
there are ears finer and subtler than those of our body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
exquisite as they are in their mechanism and in their
delicacy; there are organs of sense transcending the
physical. Within the physical brain is an organ evolving
which shall be the connecting link between those
finer senses of the finer body and the grosser senses of
the body of flesh that we wear; an organ that many of
our scientists think is an organ that is passing away, because
it is larger in the earlier stages of evolution than
in the highly developed man; it is the pituitary body. It
is not a question of size, but of inner complexity of organisation;
and that organ is not simply what science
calls it, a vestigial organ—that is, one belonging to the
evolution of the past—it is truly a rudimentary organ,
one belonging to the evolution of the future. And the
fact of that has been proved by bringing life-currents,
electric currents, to bear on that particular organ, so
that the results of the finer senses are communicated to
the brain, and we bridge what some people think the
gulf between the world of physical matter and the world
that is called that of astral matter.</p>

<p>Those experiments are now so familiar to some of us
that it is impossible for us to agree with the notion that
that organ in the brain has no future, as we find it can be
stimulated and organised more finely, and used in this
definite fashion; we know that what a few are doing
now many shall do to-morrow, and those who have done
it are only a step in front; others are treading on their
heels, and may outstrip them soon in evolution. But
here comes the difficulty, especially for the nations of
western Europe, who, from climatic and other reasons,
have taken so very largely to a diet of flesh, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
also alcohol plays a large part. Now flesh and alcohol
are not suitable materials for building up the body of our
ordinary life, which is to be made sensitive enough to
receive the vibrations from the finer matter of which I
have been speaking. Doctors have just discovered what
was published by Madame Blavatsky many years ago—that
alcohol has a direct effect on the pituitary body,
and poisons that body, tending to cause inflammation.
Have you ever wondered why it is that alcoholic excess
leads to what is called delirium tremens, in which people
see things that do not exist to the ordinary people around
them? It is because they have poisoned that very organ
by which vibrations come from other worlds; and although
what they see is largely abnormal and irrational,
it is none the less the result of action on these irregular
and poisoned bodies, which vibrate under the
stress of poison instead of under the stress of thought,
as they should do. And that which doctors now have
discovered and are publishing as a warning to people,
that has ever been known in occult science, and one of
the conditions of giving the details of the methods
whereby that body may be rendered active, has been
abstinence from alcohol, and for the simplest reason.
So long as you are not using any of these methods, it
does not so very much matter whether that body be poisoned
or not. You may live long with a poisoned pituitary
body; but the very moment that you begin to work
upon it, to make it active, to throw into it new currents
of life and energy, then the poison and the energy together
bring about inflammation of the most intractable
kind, causing severe pain, as well as brain mischief. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
it is for that reason that the methods have not been publicly
given, and are only given to those who are pure
from the taint of alcohol. Along those lines, then, you
will very likely come up against rules that many of you
will not care to adopt. We do not say adopt them; we
only say they are the conditions of the finer organisation.
Natural laws do not change for people’s wishes and
whims. If you want electric sparks from a machine
you must make the conditions; you must have dry air,
not air full of moisture. It is no good saying that dry
air is not so comfortable to breathe as moist air. You
are not obliged to have electric sparks, but if you want
them you must conform to the conditions laid down by
nature, and not follow your own whims. And that is
true everywhere. Presently people will find that it is
true when they want to investigate some of the spiritualistic
phenomena; they have not discovered that yet.
They think they can lay down the laws, and then get the
results which can only be gained by obedience. The
other day I was reading a rather curious report of investigation
into spiritualistic photographs; and when I
saw they had not obtained any, I could not help wondering
how many physical photographs they would be
able to get if they made it a rule that they should not
put a dark cloth over the camera, and that, above all,
they should not take the photographs away into the dark
room, because that gives all possibilities of cheating and
of fraud. Presently you will find out that finer nature
has her laws quite as much as grosser nature, and that
you can no more get results without obedience to those
laws than you could get your photograph if your plates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
were exposed to the light. When that is learned, progress
may be more rapid.</p>

<p>Along that line, where these rules are laid down for
the organisation of the finer bodies, there is another matter
that comes in: it is of no use to develop the finer
bodies, unless the consciousness of the higher worlds is
unfolded, and the only way to do that is by the old way
of strenuous and regular meditation. Theosophy brings
to the Western world the yoga of the East, by which
the man who practises so trains and refines his brain that
he makes it sensitive without making it diseased. There
is where the difficulty is found in the West. Sometimes,
when a great rush comes down from the higher worlds
into the body of some great saint or some great genius,
there is brain trouble and brain disturbance; hysteria is
found. Naturally, because you are overstraining your
instrument. And if you want to be able to receive those
great downflows from the higher world, then you must
begin to tune your instrument to vibrate to the swifter
vibrations that come down. You can do it, and there is
no danger unless you go to excess. If day by day you
would give even ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, to
strenuous thought and careful concentration, you would
gradually make your brain constitution more complex
and finer than it is. Thought is really the creator of the
brain. As you think, your brain grows; just as if you
exercise your muscles, your muscles grow and develop.
It is all law, and thought is the force which renders the
brain more complex in its organisation. The Indian yogi
practises that, and by practise year after year, builds
up the brain of the coming race out of the brain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
race that is. He makes it finer, subtler, more responsive,
and he does it without the sacrifice of physical health;
and that is a thing that any one of you may begin, if
only you will be moderate and not excessive. Never
concentrate to the point of making a feeling of dulness
and heaviness of the brain; never concentrate to the
point of pain; dulness and pain are the danger-signals of
nature, that you are trying to change matter more
rapidly in its arrangement than is possibly consistent
with health. Therefore you need moderation; but, given
moderation, nothing but good can come out of the
practise of meditation and concentration; and by that
you will not only make your brain more sensitive, but
also keep it sane and healthy, and you will have none of
those miserable hysterical symptoms which have so
blurred the value of the knowledge that has come through
the seer or the saint. Along those lines, then, Theosophy
works with science to show the road of development
of science in the coming civilisation.</p>

<p>What has Theosophy to do with regard to art in that
civilisation? Glance at the results of your civilisation
to-day on the beauty of the land. Go to Sheffield, which
is built in what was one of the loveliest valleys of the
Midlands; notice, as you come near it, the beauty of the
countryside, the wooding of the undulating land, the exquisite
beauty of rivulet, of forest, and of grass; and
then, out of all that beauty of Nature, you plunge suddenly
into the hideousness of Sheffield. You find the atmosphere
thick with black smoke. No tree will grow in
many of the districts, no flowers even on the sills of the
houses of the poor. The atmosphere poisons vegetation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
what do you think it does to the men, women, and children
who breathe it? And Sheffield is not alone. Go to
Glasgow; see the hideousness of that, the second metropolis
of Scotland. Go to Birmingham, to Manchester,
to any of these great cities that so largely make the
wealth of England. But sometimes it seems to me that
what you pay in beauty is too heavy a price even for
your wealth, and that England was happier as well as
healthier when she had fewer millionaires, but also
fewer stunted and deformed specimens of humanity in
her slums. Look at the faces of the men, women, and
children of one or two of those cities I have mentioned.
Look at the faces of the Glasgow crowd as it tramps
back from its labour to the slum. Those faces are not
civilised; they are brutal, many of them—animal, more
than human. Oh, you who think that beauty is only a
luxury, look at the humanity you breed, where ugliness
is the mark of the cities, instead of the beauty that has
been destroyed. You must learn to understand what
beauty means. It moulds the body, and ugliness does
the same. Out of your hideous cities a hideous humanity
grows up. The restoration of art is a matter of life and
death, not a matter of luxury and of enjoyment. Artists
are wanted in our towns much more than on the walls of
our galleries. Only a few go into the gallery, but men,
women, and children live in the town. Until the town
is beautiful, as in Greece it was beautiful, the coming
civilisation will lack one mark of the civilised man. And
Theosophy teaches reverence for beauty, whether it be
natural beauty or beauty formed by the skilful fingers
and keen brains of men—reverence for the human body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
No nation has a right to breed the bodies that we see in
the population of the slums. It is all very well that in
the richer, the upper classes you find men and women
healthy, strong, magnificent to look at; but if they can
be what they are, all ought to be able to share in the
conditions that create that beauty. And art will not
do its duty until it holds up for all to see the power that
resides in beauty, and its moulding influence on civilisation;
art should be ever painting and holding up to us
the ideal in its beauty, for it is the ideal that makes the
real. The artist should show the ideal, and the craftsman
should reproduce it; and until your craftsmen
honour their labour, there will be very little hope for
art to thrive amongst us. Art is no art when it only
paints the commonplace and the ugly. Sometimes, on
the walls of a gallery, you come across a picture made
up perhaps of a piece of cheese, and a boiled lobster, and
a string of onions, and one or two corpses of birds
thrown in for the sake of their plumage. That is not
art. Art is beauty, and to paint things like that is to degrade
art, no matter how well they may be reproduced.
“Oh,” I have heard a person say, “how beautiful that
cheese is. I could cut it!” You can cut cheese anywhere;
and you don’t want to go to a gallery, and an art
gallery, so-called, in order to see it. Put this beside the
pictures of the ancient masters, and see what art means
and what the travesty of art. Theosophy has to try to
breathe into the artist the idea of the splendour of his
calling, the divinity of his power. He can see what we
cannot see, and hear what we cannot hear; let him give
us what we cannot reach for ourselves, and be again the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
priest of the Beautiful for men. Then shall the civilisation
grow into beauty, human as well as inanimate, and
the right place of beauty shall come into our civilisation,
the place it held in ancient Greece.</p>

<p>And what shall Theosophy do in the coming civilisation
for society?—society as we see it to-day, which is a
battle, not a social order; which is an anarchy, not an
organism. I know it is often thought that changes will
only be brought about by the menace of the starving, by
the dread of revolution. Oh, it is not thus that Theosophy
looks on man, in whom it sees the growth of a
spiritual, a divine nature. You will think me a dreamer,
perhaps; and yet I tell you a truth when I say that not
by the uprising of the miserable, but by the self-sacrifice
of the comfortable will the future society be realised on
earth. I know that that is not the idea of to-day. I
know that, amongst those who suffer, such a sentiment
would be met with ridicule and scoff; but it is not those
who suffer misery who can build a wise and happy social
system. It wants the best brains and the best hearts;
it wants leisure to think out and to plan, and love to
carry into effect. You can make a riot, you can make a
revolution by starving desperate people, but there is no
stability in that which follows revolution. You cannot
take, but you can give; and the spirit lives by giving, and
knows the joy of sacrifice. Do you imagine that sacrifice
is painful, that sacrifice means sadness and gloom? I
tell you there is no joy on earth like the sacrifice of the
lower nature to the higher, and the giving to others of
the higher, that asks nothing for itself. Along those
lines our Social Redemption will come, along the lines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
those who are willing to give and willing to sacrifice, for
the gift that is compelled by law or force is always resented,
and is resisted as much as possible. Outer compulsion
is met by violent resistance, but the inner compulsion
that is the compulsion of love, that meets with no
violence in resistance; it pours itself out in joy. And
there lies the future, there the basis of the coming
civilisation.</p>

<p>I said, in the beginning, it would be built on self-sacrifice,
and that was the thought that lay behind the words.
I see, spreading through the comfortable, through the
rich, those who are well dowered with the goods of earth,
a spirit of noble discontent, not for themselves but for
others, not for themselves but for the poor. I come
across the rich and highly-placed who ask, “What can
we do to relieve the misery we see?”—who suffer by
sympathy, not by compulsion; and it is from them the
redemption of society will come. It seems, perhaps, to-day
a far-off dream, but man grows faster than we are
apt to realise. There is nothing too noble, nothing too
beautiful, nothing too divine for man to achieve; for
man is growing godlike, however slowly, and the seed of
Deity within him is beginning to flower in some hearts.
Wherever one who does not suffer is unhappy for those
who do; wherever a human brain that might amuse
itself finds joy in labour for the helping of the nation;
wherever a human heart which has all that love can give
it cannot be happy, but goes out in love to the outcast—there
lies the promise of the future. Such brains and
hearts were counted by units, perhaps, even a century
ago, by tens a little later; they are beginning to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
counted by hundreds now, and to be found in places
where none may dream that there are those who are
longing to give and strive for a better social state. In
those who are growing into the spiritual life; in those
who cannot be happy while others are miserable; in
those whose meals are rendered bitter by the starvation
of the poor; in those whose luxury is a burden because
of the want of the miserable—in those will you find the
builders of the new civilisation, those who shall sacrifice
that others may be happy. That is the future to
which we look, that the future for which we labour, proclaiming
everywhere the ancient words that “joy lives
in giving, and not in taking”; repeating again the old
message, “It is more blessed to give than to receive”;
saying once again the old truth, that only where self-sacrifice
is found, there is also found a religion and a
civilisation that can endure.</p>

<h3 id="II_Lecture_I">Lecture I<br />
<span class="smaller">The Sixth Sub-Race</span></h3>

<p>I have chosen for the subject of my lecture to-night one
which I think is important—the Sixth Sub-Race. Both
outside and inside the Theosophical Society a certain
amount of good-humoured ridicule has been cast on the
way in which Theosophists talk about Races, Sub-Races,
Root-Races, Cycles, Rounds, and so on, some people
condemning such talk as exceedingly unpractical. Really
that is not so. When our great teacher H. P. Blavatsky
traced for us <cite>The Secret Doctrine</cite>, that wonderful
panorama of the past evolution of the Races on our
globe, she was not only giving us the story of the past,
but also presenting us with the key to the future. And
I propose to-night to try to show you how it is possible
for the Theosophist who has carefully studied the principles
underlying past evolution, to apply these to the
evolution of the future, and so learn how he may best
co-operate with the divine plan which is slowly working
itself out. The advantage of Theosophical teaching
is that it gives us a definite scheme into which the
evolution of mankind, stage by stage, fits without difficulty
and without blunder.</p>

<p>Now, if we think for a moment of what we call the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
larger and the smaller cycles, we can realise that the
large scheme of the Races, the smaller scheme of the
sub-races, and the evolution of man himself, all go along
parallel lines. Understanding one, we can understand
all. I will pause on the evolution of the Races, in order
to remind you of the repetition, within the limit of each
race, of the smaller sub-races. We need not go very far
back. It will be enough to consider the Race that preceded
our own, the great fourth Root Race, and our
own. The fourth Root Race was the Atlantean. I only
allude to it in order to remind you that from the midst
of that race the Fifth Race, in its turn, arose. Now the
choosing out of a new Race is the task of a particular
Personage in the Occult Hierarchy, whose only name,
so far as we know it, is that which has been borrowed
from the Hindū, the Manu, the Man, or the Thinker, the
ideal or typical man. The Manu forms in His own mind,
after the master conception of the Planetary Logos, the
plan of the man that is to be, which He will gradually
realise along the lines of natural evolution. These laws
of evolution are used by the Manu with scientific knowledge,
and therefore with certainty. In the same way that
a scientific breeder, dealing with the animal kingdom,
can breed towards a desired type, so, on a higher plane,
does the Manu of the Race mould by the same laws of
evolution the physical form of the Race He desires to
evolve. And always the type is formed in the matter of
the higher planes before it is reproduced in the matter
of the lower, the mental and emotional characteristics
being first conceived, and then a physical body which
will best express them. The Manu chooses the type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
according to the particular qualities which are to be
evolved, which are marked out for Him by the basic
plan of the constitution of man himself. Looking at
your own nature, you have certain distinct departments:
the physical body; the astral body; the mental body;
the body of the higher mind, the causal; and then that
of the pure, compassionate Reason, the buddhic. Now
if we take those three types, the emotional, mental, and
buddhic, we have the three with which we are immediately
concerned. Desire, or emotion, was the great
characteristic of the fourth Race. The mind was the
slave of the lower feelings; that race had as its motive
power the development of the desire nature. But in
the sub-races of the fourth Race the other principles
had also to be evolved, but to a very poor degree; and as
time went on, the fifth sub-race of that began to develop
the lower mind. Out of that fifth sub-race the selection
of the Manu of the time was made, and He chose out
certain families that He thought He could shape into
the required type. The first choice was not successful,
the people proving too stiff-necked and too little plastic
to be moulded into the Race that was to be; but it left
behind it, in the history of the world, that marvellously
interesting people, the Hebrew, and that idea of being a
“chosen people” survives even to this day. The second
and successful selection had as its issue our own fifth
Root Race. Now, side by side with the evolution of the
sub-race, came the evolution of the Root Race which
was to succeed, and that is why I have referred to the
past. As the fifth sub-race of the fourth Root Race
was developed, the beginnings of the fifth Root Race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the great Aryan Race, appeared one million years
ago.</p>

<p>We can leave our fourth Race with its sub-races,
having only regarded it for the purpose of throwing
light on the present. The evolution of the fifth Race
went on, and sub-race after sub-race was born. The
earliest of all settled in Northern India, and gradually
conquered that great peninsula, the first sub-race of the
stock of the Aryans. There came out after that the second
sub-race, which wandered westward, as all the later
sub-races did; then came the third, the Irānian; then the
fourth, the Keltic; and the fifth, the Teutonic. So far we
have come in the history of the sub-races of our own
fifth Root Race. Now, notice that these overlap each
other as they develop. The first of these sub-races is still
a mighty power in Asia, showing signs that its day is
by no means done, and that the Indians, if they have
behind them a civilisation of hundreds of thousands of
years, have also before them a mighty future, the first
signs of which are being seen in the India of to-day.
Signs, some encouraging, some disturbing for a time,
are being seen on every hand that new life is being
poured into its veins, signs of the birth of a new Indian
nation. Of the second sub-race we have not any nation
at the present time. Along the Mediterranean Basin it
has left many traces of its civilisation, which are being
unburied by our archæologists; but so little mark, so to
speak, did it leave on history that a large number of its
wonders were deemed to be legends and myths. The
next sub-race, the great Persian race, is almost outworn.
The Persians of to-day have little in common with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Irānian of the past. The chief traces of them, in fact,
are on the Indian continent, the Parsīs, a race which has
dwindled and is gradually passing away. But when we
come to the fourth sub-race, the Keltic, we see great
possibilities in that still. It gave birth to the older
Greece, the country of Beauty and Philosophy. It gave
birth also to Rome, with her remarkable ruling powers.
It spread over Europe, founding one nation after another
from itself, and spreading into Ireland and Scotland,
made there possibilities that have not yet all flowered
into effect. In Ireland you have a strange mingling
of the remains of the fourth Root Race with the fourth
sub-race of the fifth; a great deal of the Atlantean influence
still exists, many of the tutelary deities of Ireland,
the gods of the mountains, being largely they
who mingled with Atlantean life and thought, and are
still exercising their potent influences over the younger
though still ancient Keltic sub-race. There, again, we
have great possibilities of revival and of growth, for the
fourth sub-race and the sixth sub-race are necessarily
interlinked. Just as the emotional nature stretches upwards
and causes sympathetic action in the spiritual
nature, so with the Races and sub-races that represent
these principles upon earth; the fourth and the sixth
Races, like the fourth and sixth sub-races, are closely
intertwined. Ireland has not been kept apart for
nothing; the separation between the Kelt and the Teuton
is not without its meaning. We shall find among that
Keltic people possibilities of spiritual power, and we
may look possibly for some mighty influence to flow
thence into the great Christian organisation of Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
who is now on the balance as to whether she is to sink
down along the line that the Papal Encyclical seems to
trace for her and become the enemy of the Spirit of the
Age, or whether the Modernist party in the Roman
Church is to rise into power, purify and vivify that ancient
Communion, and make her again what she ought
to be, the Church of Saints, the type and symbol of the
purest and loftiest form of Christian thought. It may
be that Ireland will co-operate also in the great purification
which I pray may come to the Roman Communion,
and make its revival possible. And that is closely connected
with the sixth Root Race, and therefore partly
with the sixth sub-race.</p>

<p>Now, after the fourth sub-race came our own; and
when we find that this fifth sub-race, the Teutonic, is
carrying on so rapidly the development of the concrete
and scientific mind, when we notice that it is beginning
its last conquest, the conquest of the air, then, if we
have learned the lesson of the past, we may learn to see
the signs of the sub-race which is to succeed it. But
these sub-races overlap each other, and it is at the moment
of the zenith of the one that the next is born.
Go back to the zenith of the fourth sub-race, when the
fifth was beginning to develop, when Rome was mighty,
then it was that the Goths in German forests were beginning
to be born into Europe; and to draw together
into tribes, which were to grow into nations. Quietly
and silently the new sub-race was being born while its
predecessor was reaching the highest point of the civilised
world of its time. Slowly it began to develop its
own peculiarities and powers, and from that day the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Teutonic sub-race has grown stronger and stronger,
more and more dominant, and, though a small minority
compared with the population of the world, is dominating
that world by the force of its scientific mind, spreading
everywhere, and making itself the very crest of the
advancing wave.</p>

<p>But let us turn away our eyes from the dazzling glow
of the present to look for the quiet places where the
birth of the future is beginning to appear. Just because
the fifth sub-race is so strong and dominant, we look
over the world for the beginnings of its successor, which
shall rule the world not by the force of the concrete
mind, but by the force of the pure and compassionate
Reason, which will conquer not by power but by love,
not by competition but by co-operation, and found, therefore,
an Empire that will long endure. For it is true
now as ever that “They that take the sword shall perish
by the sword,” and the Empire that is to live will be the
Empire that wins its way by love and benediction, that
is a teacher and a defender, and not only a ruler. The
sixth sub-race, the Coming Race, will be born with the
sixth Root Race in it, which is to grow so much more
slowly. The coming of the sixth sub-race you may
almost begin to see around you. It is not to be born in
a single place, not to belong to a single nation, for it is
the type of humanity, of the unifying Wisdom, and out
of all nations and all peoples and all tongues it will
gather together its chosen for the new type of thought
which is to be born. And what that type will be we can
easily outline by thinking of the characteristics of the
buddhic principle in man. What are those characteristics?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
First of all, union, and hence in the outer world co-operation.
The very essence of all action in the sixth
sub-race will be the union of many to achieve a single
object, and not the dominance of one who compels others
to his will. The work of the future will not be, “Do so-and-so
and follow me,” but, “Let us advance together to
a goal that we all realise as desirable of attainment.”
If you are looking for the sign of anyone who is beginning
to show the marks of that sixth sub-race to-day,
you will find it in those who lead by love, sympathy, and
comprehension, and not by dominance of an imperious
will; for the qualities of that sub-race will be found scattered
here and there through the sub-race which it is
gradually to supplant. You may trace out the coming
of the sixth sub-race in the scattered people found in
our fifth sub-race, in whom tenderness is the mark of
power. Anyone who desires to take part in the building
of that race needs to develop now the power to work
with others rather than against them, and so, by a continual
common effort, to replace the spirit of antagonism
and competition. It is a synthesising spirit which we
shall find in the forerunners of our sixth sub-race—those
who are able to unite diversity of opinion and of character,
who are able to gather round them the most unlike
elements and blend them into a common whole, who
have that capacity for taking into themselves diversities
and sending out again unities, and utilising the most different
capacities, finding each its place, and welding all
together into a strong whole. That is one of the characteristics
which marks the type of being out of whom
this sixth sub-race will gradually develop. A strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
marked characteristic will be compassion. That virtue
is comparatively rare in the energetic, strongly individualised
West. Compassion is that quality which is at
once affected by the presence of weakness, answering to
it with patience, with tenderness, and with protection.
You may notice how very often amongst ourselves, taking
the ordinary fifth sub-race type, the presence of
weakness is provocative. It does not call out compassion,
but impatience—very characteristic of the fifth sub-race.
Quick to understand and grasp a fact, it is impatient with
the weakness and mental dulness which cannot easily appreciate
the differences which seem to it so clear. The
typical fifth sub-race civilisation is a civilisation that sees
in weakness a field to exploit, a thing to enslave, something
to trample under foot, in order to rise on it, and
not to help to exist for itself. “Inevitable,” you say, “in
a bustling civilisation like this, that the weak should go
to the wall.” I do not deny that it has been inevitable in
the development of the strong individualism of the present.
That individualism is a priceless result, cheaply
bought even by the suffering it has caused. Without that
strong individualism you would not have the foundation
on which the great co-operative civilisation could be
built. For you cannot synthesise weaknesses, and it was
necessary to make the strong and patient individuality in
order that you might have something to blend together
into a harmony in the future that is yet to be born. It
is a very shortsighted view of human nature which sees
in the growth of a particular quality a thing which is
wholly undesirable; for there is nothing which is wholly
undesirable in the evolution which is guided by perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Wisdom and perfect Love. The most unlovely product
of the fifth sub-race civilisation will be one of the bricks
that will be built into the foundation of the sixth sub-race
and of the sixth Root Race. For out of the strong
individuality the strong virtues can be built, and compassion
is a virtue of the strong, and not of the weak.
The feeble, sentimental sympathy that comes with the
poor and undeveloped nature is not compassion. It has
no power of healing in it, and no power of protection.
The person who, seeing a suffering or wrong, or even a
physical accident, goes into hysterics over it, is not the
strong helper who heals and protects. It is not the
skilful nurse who goes into hysterics over the agony of
the patient in pain, leaving that patient to suffer while
she is having the cheap luxury of sentimental tears. It
is only out of the strong natures you can build up real
compassion. The compassion which does not help is
useless, and help can only be given where knowledge
guides feeling, and understanding shapes the remedy.
Hence out of these strong individualities, when their
object has been changed and the greater Self has taken
the place of the smaller self, out of those the sixth sub-race,
which has pure Reason for its dominating principle,
will gradually appear. When in yourselves you find the
germs of compassion, and know that that is to be part
of the dominating characteristic of the coming sub-race,
then cherish these germs to the utmost. But remember
that they must grow out of the germinal feeling of
sympathy into the strong power to uplift and to save;
for compassion is the great mark of the Saviour. And
the Saviour is never weak, but strong, and out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
strength grows his compassion. You can test it for
yourself. Having to deal with someone who is very slow,
you are impatient. Why? Because you are weak. You
are not strong enough to make a question clear with
slow and deliberate intent, not strong enough to bear
with the stupidity and feebleness.</p>

<p>The next great thing you want is the sense of unity,
and that you can never have unless you are strong.
There is nothing harder in the world than to pierce
through a man’s weakness and his poor qualities, which
are on the surface, and to see within the growing power
of the God. Yet that is what you have to do if you
would be truly wise. You see in the people around you
to-day a large number of faults. How far do you see
behind every fault the seed of divinity which will develop
into a virtue? Has the old Platonic idea ever struck you,
that there is no strong dividing line between the vice
and virtue except the quantity which is present? The
undeveloped virtue is a vice; the virtue in excess is also
a vice. The golden mean between the two is the virtue.
Take a common illustration—cowardice on one side,
recklessness on the other. Courage is the mean between
the two. And so in everything excess is vice, whether
a defect or a surplusage, and the perfect equilibrium
between them alone is virtue. If you would realise that
for yourselves, wherever you see a vice in your neighbour,
you will look through the vice to the virtue that
shall be, and in the greatest faults of the present you
learn to see the promise of the future. You find a person
intolerant. He thinks you are a fool because you
cannot see the same way as he. This is apt to wake in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
you a similar intolerance. But if you saw through the
intolerance the growing though undeveloped love of
virtue, if you saw through the intolerance the passionate
desire to find the right and do it, the passionate hatred
of all that does not seem right, you would be very
patient; for presently the flower of the virtue will blossom
out and show the beauty which all the time was
within. You hear abuse, or slander, or calumny. You
think it is hateful. But the person who is doing it in
his ignorance is mistaken, and that is a reason for compassion,
and not for anger. The more cruel the ignorance
may make a person, the greater the demand for the
compassion, which, because it understands all, overcomes
all; nay, does not even overcome, because to overcome
would mean separation; but realises the unity between
oneself and another, and takes the weakness of another
as one’s own. Now these things are well enough known
in principle. Why not practise them? Why, in difficulties
like those we have been passing through, should there be
angry words on both sides? The Theosophist who understands
has no room for anger, but only room for compassion.
These are the things that in the sixth sub-race
we shall want. All these must begin to grow now, and
germinate in the heart of every one of you who would
take part in the building of that coming sub-race. And
hardest of all to develop, in a race where separateness
has been the type of greatness, is the sense of unity. This
sense of unity and of compassion will be a strength and
power which is only one for service, which makes the
measure of strength the measure of responsibility and
of duty. And so your character will be marked—if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
are a candidate for the sixth sub-race—will be marked
by a great sense of duty, and a great indifference to what
are called “rights.” There is a splendid word of Mazzini
that “every right grows out of a duty discharged.”
That is utterly true. It is the discharge of duty out of
which inevitably the right grows, and then the right
comes not by combat, but by the inevitable necessity of
nature. Because where everyone discharges his duty,
everyone enjoys his rights without conflict and without
demand. The mark of our own sub-race is the demanding
of our rights. But to those who know the law
of karma there is nothing that need be claimed, because
you possess all which is yours. The karma brings to
you everything to which you have a right; and if what
is called an injustice is done you, it is only the balancing
up of an ancient wrong. You think people can hurt you.
Then you do not believe in the law of karma. It is your
own hand that strikes you, and no one else’s. No one
can injure you or wrong you, no one can commit any
injustice against you. The whole of that which you
suffer comes out of your past. These people are mere
puppets who come forward to claim the debt that you
have to pay. If you really believed that, then the man
who demands a debt from you would be your friend
whom you would welcome; for karma’s debts are never
demanded twice. There is no error in her account.
But, as a matter of fact, hardly any of you believe it in
actual life. What you profess does not make one scrap
of difference. You do not believe unless you live what
you say you believe. And if you believed it, you would
know that no slander could wrong you, no injury hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
you, and that the words of the Christ on His way to His
Passion were absolutely true: “You could do nothing
at all against me except it were given you from above.”
That is the secret of the patience of the Christs; they
know the law, they live by it and accept it. And that
utter belief in Law, and therefore the recognition of
duty, that is another of the great marks of the race that
is to be. Every one of you who works that out now in
life, who, in face of an apparent wrong, is calm and receptive,
who takes an injustice as a debt that is paid and
cancelled, that man or woman is a candidate for the
coming sub-race, and for the Root Race that shall be
gathered out of its midst. For the sixth Root Race is to
be taken out of the sixth sub-race that is now being born,
and according to the qualities you make in yourselves
will be the effectiveness of your candidature for both.</p>

<p>And now look at another side of that growing sub-race.
I have laid most stress on qualities, because qualities
shape form; but it is also true that the bodies of that
sub-race will show a different type from the bodies of
the present—will be far more sensitive to all the finer
vibrations of matter, built up within the finer aggregations.
And side by side with the development of the
finer and more nervous physical body will be inevitably
the greater organisation of the body that comes next,
the astral, with its corresponding senses. Now notice
how in the difference between the fourth and fifth Root
Races it is the nervous system which is the greatest
physical difference. Compare the nervous system of a
Chinaman, or Japanese, with the nervous system of an
Aryan, and you will see the enormous gulf that separates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the two Races. A fourth Race man will recover easily
from a tremendous laceration that would have killed
a fifth Race man by mere nervous shock, and it is in
your nervous system that there will be the great difference
between the fifth and sixth Root Races, and the
change will show in the sixth sub-race. You have to
solve one of the hardest physical problems; to have a
sensitive, delicate, complicated nervous system hand in
hand with complete health. You can easily strain your
system into sensitiveness, but that is different to refining
it into sensitiveness, making it responsive to the most
delicate vibrations from without, but with a perfect
sanity and health. On that you can also work. By the
deliberate use of meditation for the refining of the brain
you can gradually build up—if you do not carry it to
excess—an extreme sensitiveness, and at the same time
perfect balance and sanity and health. You must not
think that with fifth Race bodies you can bring about at
once sixth Race characteristics; but within the limitations
imposed upon you by your fifth Race bodies you
can gradually develop an increasing sensitiveness which
will react on the astral body, and organise and develop
that at the same time. And you will find, if you will
notice the people round you, that there are being born
at the present time more and more children who show
this delicate sensitiveness, hand in hand with generosity,
with tenderness, with broadness of mind, with quick and
keen intelligence. These are children who will gradually
develop into the type of the new sub-race. When they
become numerous, and become fathers and mothers in
their turn, then they will gradually prepare for the birth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of the children who will belong to the sixth Root Race.
Within the one the other will be born. Hence all of you
who are parents will do rightly and wisely to study
carefully the characters and types of the children whom
karma places in your hands for training. If you see in
them the dawning powers of the coming sub-race, this
greater sensitiveness, this tendency to see where many
are blind, do not force it by unwise admiration, do not
check it by equally unwise unbelief. Let the children of
to-day grow up among the healthiest possible conditions,
but also amongst the most refined that you can give them.
Remember that in the training of the higher emotions
beauty is an essential factor, and that without the
bringing of beauty into home and daily life the birth and
growth of the coming sub-race will be hindered. You
have to war against the ugliness of the present-day
civilisation. You have to strengthen the tendencies
which are beginning to show themselves, and which
make for beauty. You must realise that beauty is an
essential part of utility; and that it is the most narrow-minded
utility which thinks that beauty can be left on
one side, and that the ugliness in daily life is not a
retarding factor in the growth of the more refined sub-race
that will partially take birth amongst us. These
are very practical things. They deal with your daily
life, with the home of every one of you, and the duties
that fall upon you there. You must not let your Theosophy
be outside your daily life. If Theosophy is to
be the moulding force of the race that is to be born, it
must show itself out in your lives, in your thought and
action. It is the great privilege of the Theosophical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Society to be the nucleus of that coming Root Race, and
amongst our members there should be some at least
ready to take part in the building of the sixth sub-race.
You would not be amongst us if you had not had in you
something to draw you along the lines of this swifter
evolution. You hardly appreciate the forces of the past
which have brought you into the Society. Some come
in and drop out again. They are those who are coming
in touch with it for the first time. Others come in and
stay in for years, and then drop out. They are in a
stage a little further on, and have been in it before, and
will return to it in lives to come. There are some who,
gripped by it from the beginning, never move again in
their utter fealty to its ideals, whom no personalities can
throw out of it, who belong to Theosophy rather than
have Theosophy belonging to them. These are they
who have been in it many a time before, and will come
into it again, to live and die in it over and over again,
life after life. Well for you who are here to-day that
in the trials of the last few years you have not allowed
personalities to blind you to principles, nor real or
imaginary faults in persons to make you shrink in your
loyalty to Theosophy itself. Persons die; principles
live. Men and women pass away with their virtues and
faults, but the Theosophical Society will endure generation
after generation. Well for you if in the storm you
have been able to stand firm; great the benediction that
comes upon you that in the day of trial you have not
denied your Master, in the day of suffering you have not
forsaken and fled away.</p>

<h3 id="II_Lecture_II">Lecture II<br />
<span class="smaller">The Immediate Future</span></h3>

<p>You may remember that when we last met I spoke to
you about the sixth sub-race, and my speech this evening
turns on the same set of ideas, although from a different
standpoint, rather more special to the Society than to the
world at large. In this lecture I am concerned rather
with the view of the nature of the Theosophical Society
which was held in its earliest days, dropped a little out
of sight, and is now being very generally recalled, so
that the Society should rise to the height of its opportunity
and do the work that lies before it in the immediate
future. If you will turn back to the days of H. P.
Blavatsky in India you will find she was fond of dwelling
on a particular relation held by two of the Masters,
primarily to the Society, and secondarily to the coming
civilisation of which the Society is the herald. She used
to refer her Hindū friends to the statements in their own
Purānas, in which it was said that two Kings would
come at the end of the Age, and that to them would be
given the kingdom of the new and opening Age. These
statements, which are often repeated, raised in the
hearers the inquiry, “Who are the two Kings?” and
then she gave them a hint that the two Kings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Purānas were the two Masters who were the real
Founders of the Theosophical Society. That set the
keen brains of the students to work. They promptly
began to try and find out what were the names of the
two Kings. One of these students found it, wrote a
paper, which was published with H. P. Blavatsky’s approval,
giving the names of the two Kings—Moru and
Devāpi—two names mentioned in many of the Purānas
in relation to the past history of the Hindūs, one of them,
Moru, belonging to the Solar Dynasty, descending directly
from Rāma, one of the Avatāras—that before
Shrī Krshna—a great King, said to have retired from his
throne and to have gone to Shamballa, there to wait until
he was recalled to lead the human race; the other, whose
name was given as Devāpi, was the elder brother of the
famous King of the Lunar Dynasty, to which the next
Avatāra belonged. He was the elder brother of the
father of Bhīshma, and he similarly gave up his right
to the crown, retired to the same place, and the same
phrase is used with regard to him, that he was to wait
there the coming age. Now H. P. Blavatsky was very
much delighted at the ingenuity of her students, and said
that the outline was correct, and it was published. H. P.
Blavatsky often referred to this function of the two
Masters who were responsible for the founding of the
Society. As in these latter days that idea of the Masters
as the Founders of the Society has been challenged, I
may perhaps say I have myself seen that fact stated in
the writing of the Master “M.” I have read the letter
in which He says that He and His fellow Adept “K. H.”
had taken on themselves the responsibility of a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
spiritual movement in the world; that there was some
doubt in the Lodge as to the wisdom of the movement
at that time; and that they were allowed to take that
step only on the condition that they should found and
work the Society through others whom they could direct
and control. Then He went on to say that He had
chosen a disciple of his own, H. P. Blavatsky, and that
He had sent her to America to look for another disciple,
H. S. Olcott, and that these were the outer founders of
the Society. Hence to me and to many others who
believe that these letters are genuine the nature of the
origin of the Society cannot be a matter of doubt.</p>

<p>Starting, then, from that standpoint, we find certain
things were said by H. P. Blavatsky as regards the
nature of the Society, and certain things by the Masters
themselves. Both are very important for us in consideration
of the immediate future. The first of these
things was indicated by hints which the more advanced
students could understand—that the inner purpose of
the Society was to prepare the world for the coming of
a new Race, and to be itself the nucleus of that Race;
that one of the Teachers was to be the Manu of the
race, the other the Bodhisattva. Now those exact facts
were unpublished at the time, but they passed from one
to the other among the more advanced students of that
period. Coming into the Society in 1889, this particular
fact did not come within my knowledge until 1895.
After the Coulomb struggle the Society for a time
dropped away from the occult path on which H. P.
Blavatsky had started it, and these ideas fell out of
sight and were forgotten except by a limited number.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
In 1895 they were re-communicated to myself by my
own Master, and have since been passed on to the older
members of the Theosophical Society.</p>

<p>Let us pause for a moment on the statement with
regard to the Manu and Bodhisattva. Every Root Race
has for its guide a great Adept, much higher than the
great ones we call the Masters, and that office filled by
a mighty Being is an office the name of which indicates
simply the man, the thinker. The connotation is the ideal,
typical man, making rather the emphasis on the article
“the.” The name is peculiarly suitable, because each of
these Manus at the head of the Root Race is the type
of the Race over which he is to preside. The types of
the seven Races are part of the plan of the Planetary
Logos, and that plan is worked out, stage after stage, by
the Manus of the races. It is left to the Manu Himself
how He shall proceed with His work. He takes the
responsibility of the method He chooses. When the
time comes to plan out the new Race, then the coming
Manu begins to take up His office, and always in connection
with another great Brother of His own rank,
who is called the Bodhisattva. The Manu of the Fifth
Race, as you know, collected His people together out of
the fifth sub-race of the Fourth Root Race, sent out
messengers to call them together, brought them together,
moulded them generation after generation, and at last
evolved them to the necessary physical type. For the
work of the Manu is double: to choose out those who
show in consciousness the germs of the new stage which
is to evolve in the coming Race; then, having chosen
them out and stimulated that germ within them, to set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to work to shape the necessary bodies. Now in that far-off
time our own Manu of the fifth Root Race had to
choose materials out of the fifth sub-race, and He did
not choose at all those who were regarded as the best
specimens of the day. Remember that the fourth sub-race,
like the fourth Root Race as a whole, showed out
very powerfully all the passional characteristics and the
psychic qualities which accompanied them. It was the
fourth sub-race, the Toltec, which made the great Empire,
with the city of the Golden Gate as metropolis, that
whose armies spread over the known world, conquering
everywhere, and in that sub-race psychic qualities naturally
played a great part. You will remember that
at the earlier stage of great emotional and passional
manifestation, psychic qualities are very largely developed
before the development of the lower mind. That
evolution belongs to the astral body as a whole, working
not through the astral chakras, but through the astral
centres connected with our physical senses. The fourth
sub-race carried all that to the highest point. Children
in the schools were picked out for their paths in life by
clairvoyance; and in all matters of policy, statecraft, etc.,
clairvoyants were consulted, so that by the exercise of
the psychic qualities they might get the best possible
knowledge to be had at the time. Now the characteristics
of the fifth sub-race were the diminution of psychic
power and the germinating of the seed of mind, and these
two things necessarily went together, so that, as that
fifth sub-race developed, the people of it were rather
looked down upon by the highly evolved psychic sub-race
which preceded it. These people seemed to be inferior;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
they could not use the powers which put their predecessors
in the very forefront of civilisation, and made this
world and the astral world almost one and the same.
The children born with very little of these psychic powers,
the men and women who showed still less of it, were
by no means thought to have within them the promise of
the future. Yet out of these the Manu chose His
material, because they showed the germ of the mind
which was specially wanted as the characteristic of the
coming Race. It did not matter that it was only a germ,
or that they were much less effective than the people of
the mighty civilisation in which they appeared. He was
looking to the future, and so these people were by no
means the people whom the Atlanteans of the day would
have chosen if consulted in the matter. But the great
people do not always consult with the smaller people,
who are so very sure of the rightness of their own
judgment. They have an uncomfortable way of following
their own ideas; and, as the Master “M” once
said of some people who remarked that He did not come
up to their idea of an Adept, “The mark of the Adept is
not kept at Simla.” And that sentence is rather a good
one to remember. So also the mark of the disciple is not
kept in London or in Chicago, but in a very different part
of the world, and to that those who know something
about it try to conform. So the choice of the Manu of
the day would have been regarded as a very poor one by
the wise folk of the time. Nevertheless he carried away
his people and built them up into a great Race.</p>

<p>Now there is something very instructive in that when
we try to understand the method of His choice in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
light of the past, and the analogy of principles. For we
can see that if the germs of a sixth sub-race—from
which, later, a sixth Root Race will be born—are to be
chosen out by Him from the materials that the fifth sub-race
affords, then the nature of His choice probably will
not be that which would be made by the leaders of that
fifth sub-race itself. Theirs to carry on to the highest
point the concrete, scientific mind, which is the glory of
their sub-race. Theosophists sometimes ask: “Why do
not the great men of Science come into the Theosophical
Society?” Simply because they have their own work to
do; and their work at present is not to build the future
civilisation, but to lead to its highest point the present
one. In the future, when they shall have led that civilisation
to the highest point, and when it has taken its
place at the head of the world’s thought, then will come
the time for these great minds to be reborn into another
race, and build on the splendid intellectual foundation
they have laid. The work of the world is the end that
the great Ones consider, and these strong scientific minds
to-day are needed by the world to carry on the present
civilisation to the highest point. How unwise it would
be to take them away from the work that no one else can
do, and set them to other work they would do badly, not
having turned their energies to the particular qualifications
that are wanted for it. And so in the wise plan
of the Manu of the fifth Race, the flower of the fifth or
Teutonic sub-race is taken in order that it may be raised
up to the highest point of the mānasic civilisation, and be
carried on to its zenith of splendour of scientific knowledge.
But meanwhile it is His duty to help in the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
up of the other types—still his Race is the sixth sub-race—and
so to co-operate with His successor the Manu
of the sixth Root Race. For remember the Manu of all
the sub-races of a Root Race is the same. He is the
Manu of the whole Race; when the time comes for beginning
the new Root Race, then the Manu of the Race
that is regnant co-operates with the Manu of the Race
which is to come. Hence He who is to be the Manu of
the sixth Root Race, the Master “M,” the Moru of the
Purānas, He has begun His work. And He has begun
it in a humble and insignificant fashion, as the world
would say, by striking the keynote of Brotherhood, and
by drawing into a Society those whose hearts thrill responsive
to that note. And why? Because the higher
emotion that answers to universal Brotherhood, to love
of all, without distinction of race, sex, caste, colour, or
creed—that is the emotion, that is the germ of the buddhic
principle in man, the principle of unifying, of
drawing the separated together, of blending into one
separate individualities, and making them realise the
spiritual unity which overshadows and underlies them
all. Hence universal Brotherhood is the only thing
which is binding on members of the Theosophical Society.
Nothing else. The Theosophical teachings as to
Karma, Reincarnation, or the Masters, are not binding
on the mind or conscience of any member. This is an
important point. It is not only because a truth is better
seen by the unfettered intellect than by an intellect
on which a dogma is imposed, though that is of importance;
but because the material which can be moulded
into the Coming Race is the material that can recognise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the necessity and the beauty of universal Brotherhood,
and if that be recognised, nothing else for the moment is
necessary. Hence that is the only binding principle.
Hence, also, the attempts to narrow it down, prompted
by those Dark Powers who do not desire that the Society
should grow and prosper for thousands of years to
come, the attempts to put in a little restraint here and a
little obstacle there, judging for the moment, and not for
the future. That is the inner meaning of having that
one thing alone our bond of union. And so the Manu
made that the keynote to attract those who would answer,
“Yes; that is the very thing I want to join in and
help.” And so the nucleus of the great sixth Root Race
began to be formed. But that is not an immediate future,
although already beginning. The sixth sub-race is
the immediate future; under the rule of the Manu of the
fifth still, but co-operating with the Manu of the Sixth,
in order that those who show signs of being fit material
for the Coming Race may have a preliminary practise of
the virtues of that race. Hence the stress that H. P.
Blavatsky laid on this inner side of the working of the
Theosophical Society; and hence the need, because the
time is passing rapidly, to make public what has been
kept private in the past of this inner purpose, which has
really dominated the Society from within, although not
recognised without.</p>

<p>Let us see how that immediate future should be recognised
in its characteristics, and thus prepared for. First
of all we must understand the words spoken long ago
under the inspiration of the coming Bodhisattva, that the
Theosophical Society was to be “the corner-stone of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
future religion of humanity.” Now every sub-race has
a special religion, as it were. The religion of the fifth
sub-race is Christianity. What is the future religion of
humanity in this sense? It differs from all that have
gone before. It is no longer an exclusive and separatist
faith, but a recognition that in every religion the same
truths are found; that there is only one true religion, the
Divine Wisdom; and that every separate religion is true
just so far as it incorporates the main teachings of that
Divine Wisdom. The one supreme religion is the Knowledge
of God; to that everything else is subsidiary. Just
in so far as any special religion puts within the reach of
its followers the means for rising to that supreme
knowledge, in so far is that religion worthy of its place.
And when that supreme test is not thoroughly answered—when
dogmas, and ceremonies, and rites become more
important than this inner truth of the gaining of individual
knowledge of the Supreme—then the religion becomes
narrower, weaker, unspiritual, until a time comes
when either the religion must die or a new impulse must
be poured into it to bring it back to its original position,
a channel for the knowledge of God. Now, in the past
many religions have done their work and passed away,
and we come to the present time, when certain great
religions are living. And when the great new spiritual
impulse came, it was not charged with the building of a
new religion, but with the vitalising of those great existing
religions, to make them realise their underlying foundation;
they were vivified in order to help them to rise
to a more spiritual and mystic interpretation of their
teachings; and when that was done, they were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
blended together into a brotherhood of Religions, so
that all should recognise the Divine Wisdom as their
root. That was the first work of the Theosophical
Society. It was done all over the world. See how in
India Hindūism was revived; in Ceylon, Buddhism. Ask
the ordinary missionary who comes over here, who is not
generally very broad-minded, and he will tell you that
the great opponent of Christianity in the East is the
Theosophical Society. Then, if you press him and ask,
“But are Theosophists antagonistic to you?” “No,”
he will say, “but they strengthen the other religions, and
thus prevent our making converts.” And that is true.
It is not our business to convert people from one religion
to another, but to try to make every one realise the
splendour of his own religion. Naturally, in India—except
in Travancore, where there has been a Christian
Roman Catholic colony from the very early centuries of
the Church—Christianity is an alien religion, and only
grows by injuring the older religions of the land. Naturally,
then, the missionaries look on the Theosophical
Society as an opponent, because it has been the great
factor in the revival of Hindūism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism,
and is beginning to be a factor in the revival
of Muhammadanism. Now, when you see that, and
when you come to the West and see how the same influence
has been widening the Christian Church, how
mystical Christianity is spreading everywhere in a way
that would have seemed incredible some three years ago—see
how narrow it was, and look now, how everywhere
the mystic thought is spreading, and see how, in the
Roman Catholic Church, the spreading of this spirit has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
become so wide that the Pope is forced into fulminating
against it, and in the Modernism that he condemns we
find Theosophy mentioned as one of the forms—you will
realise that that part of the work is almost done. I do
not mean that we are not to continue spreading abroad
more spiritual ideas, but that the work has been done so
effectively already that it is almost passing into the hands
of the religions themselves. The clergy are now preaching
so much Theosophy that it hardly seems necessary
to continue preaching the parts they have adopted. The
Theosophical teaching as to the nature of the Christ in
His birth in the human form, and His growth into Divine
Manhood—how common a doctrine that is now within all
the Churches of the West. The fact of Reincarnation is
also becoming more and more widely accepted—a doctrine
no longer to be laughed at, but to be carefully argued
over, and forming a part of the deepest thought of
the Christian world. So that while we must still go on
with that part of the work, there are other parts of our
work now that we ought to be ready to take up. That
religion of the future which is to include all the religions
as sects within itself, all of them going on into the future,
but recognising themselves as a Brotherhood, that is to be
the dominant religious thought of the great sixth Root
Race, and in the sixth sub-race we shall find it spreading
everywhere. Now, how mighty will be the advantage;
because the moment all religions are seen to be branches
of one stock, then each religion can share with others the
specialty which it has been its duty to develop in the
world. And nowadays, when the Christian goes to
India, instead of trying to convert the Hindū, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
can never do, what he ought to do is to offer to share
with him that great special characteristic of Christianity,
the principle of self-sacrifice, and the helping of the
weaker by the stronger—the dominant note of Christianity.
It is the doctrine of the Cross, the emblem of
self-sacrifice, of the coming down to the depressed in
order to lift them, leading them up side by side with
ourselves. That is the noblest thought of Christendom,
typified in the mystic Christ; and that you might well
offer to share with the Hindūs, for that does not come
out so strongly in their great Faith. Rather will they
bring to you in exchange the doctrine of the immanence
of God. Two things, Dr. Miller has written, Hindūism
brings to the world: the immanence of God, and the solidarity
of man. When religions exchange their best instead
of finding out each other’s weaknesses, then you
have outlined the religion of the future. Our work in
that future is to continue what we have so well begun,
and spread this liberal, thoughtful, religious ideal
through all religions, destroying none, but permeating all.</p>

<p>Next we have to consider what we ought to do in the
training of the next generation; for there is great need
that the Theosophical ideal of education should spread
through Western minds, and especially through Britain
and its empire. Religious education at the present time
is in peril; how great that peril is may be measured by
the Moral Education Congress gathered together in
London last year to try to find a moral basis that should
furnish education apart from all the sanctions of religion—a
hopeless task, but none the less a sign of the peril
of the times. Now, we have had secular education in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
India. It has been the English education the Government
has given there. It could not give any other because
of the different religions of the country, and it was
bound not to help any one of these to the detriment of
the others. The moral result has been disastrous. It
has fostered selfishness, indifference to the country, lack
of public spirit. It has given us a race of men who have
acquired from the West its superficial qualities, but not
its inner strength, not its inner capacity. And the troubles
you have in India now are largely the result of this anti-religious
education, which has made hundreds of the best
Indian type skeptics, a thing which has only been checked
with the growth of the Theosophical Society throughout
India. We have turned back that irreligious wave, with
the result that the Indian Government to-day regards the
Theosophical Society as the most likely agency for training
the youth of India along lines of freedom and order
at the same time. They realise that we have put our
finger on the weak point in their own system, and that
our plan of giving to the child the religion of his parents
is really the way to solve that religious problem in India.
Now, over here you have to face the problem how to preserve
religion while letting dogmatism go; how to find a
common ground, a few common principles, which all
Christians inculcate, leaving to a later time in life the
special sectarian divisions which the young man and woman
can acquire later if they wish. Now, in that the
Theosophical Society may well play a great part in the
immediate future, strengthening all the influences which
make for the keeping of religion as an integral part of
education, helping to soften the bitter sectarianism, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
persuade the different denominations to remember that
they are Christians more than that they belong to this,
that, or the other denomination. If we succeed in that,
then the service to the education of the empire will be
supreme.</p>

<p>Along other lines we want, if we can, to persuade the
public mind to become a little more receptive of new
ideas; to lose a little of its pride, and learn a little
humility. Unless we are quite sure that we are at the
very top of human evolution, and that nothing greater
than ourselves can be evolved, then it would be the part
of wisdom to recognise that the next type, which is the
type of the future, must be different from the type of the
present, and, in the beginning of its evolution, new and
strange. You may remember how J. S. Mill, in speaking
of liberty, laid immense stress on originality, and complained
that modern methods were tending to make all
come to a single level; to do away with the eccentric,
even with the original. Now, for growth, variety is
wanted. Where there is no spontaneous variation in
types, you have stagnation. And yet every one of us is
so fond of our own particular line of thought that we
take it almost as an offence if someone starts a new
thought which we cannot at once fit into our own mental
grooves. Now, we must try to correct that, first in ourselves,
and then in the public at large, especially in view
of the coming of that mighty Teacher I have spoken of.
When He comes, the type of the sixth Root Race, He
must be very different from all of us, otherwise He
would not be the type of the new departure. How can
we avoid treating Him when He comes exactly as our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
predecessors of the fourth sub-race treated Him when
He came last to start the fifth? It is so easy for all of
us, looking back to the mighty Figure of the Christ, to
realize something of its splendour, but we see Him
through the glamour of the religion which has made His
name supreme in many of your hearts. Try and put
yourselves back in time, and see how strange that new
type would have then seemed to you, how against all
your prejudices. So different was He that He raised an
antagonism so bitter that they could not bear Him
amongst them for more than three years, and then murdered
Him. It is hard for us to realise that. We are
apt to think, “If I had been there, I would have stood
beside Him; I would not have been amongst those who
slew Him.” And yet there is no particular reason to
think we should not have done the same. It is a great
lesson for the immediate future. For when He comes
again to bless this beginning of a sixth sub-race, the
buddhic, He will show out the qualities of Buddhi prominently,
and those are by no means very acceptable to the
modern world. Look fairly at your own minds and see
how you stand on your rights. It is the spirit of the time.
If you have not what you think your rights, you make a
clamour for them. For the mānasic civilisation that is
the proper way, but those who want to go on in the new
future that is dawning have to throw all that aside. You
must relinquish your “rights.” If you are trampled on,
you must recognise that it is only yourself of the past
trampling on yourself of the present: no one can trample
on you except a person who embodies your own past
injustice, and is working out that which you yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
have created. That is a very unpopular view, as unpopular
as the Sermon on the Mount. And so along many
other lines of that which is admirable from the popular
standpoint—power, dominance, the spirit which tramples
down all opposition. How different from that of the
Wisdom which rules, but rules from within, “mightily
and sweetly ordering all things.” And if you will think
over this in detail and work it out, you will find you will
have to change your ideal of what is admirable, and
build up on ideal on the basis of Spirit and unity, and not
on rights and claims. And that is one reason why the
Theosophical ideals very often find themselves rejected
in the outer world. Those are the qualities needed for
the world as it shall be; and if we are to be builders of
that immediate future, we must develop them in ourselves.
But you may say: “Is it not rather a big assertion
to make that this Theosophical Society is really a
nucleus of a great Root Race; that it is the beginning of
a sub-race? What right have you to make such a claim?”
The answer is, that looking back to the last choice, we
should expect to find the beginning of the new Race and
new sub-race among those who were not the leaders of
the present, but had in them the germ of the future.
That is why our people are gathered not from the leaders
and the thinkers, but from the loving, the compassionate,
the brotherly. It seems a feeble thing, this power
of Brotherhood. It is the mightiest thing in all the
world. And although it is true that we cannot expect
to find amongst us men and women of magnificent intellect
and overwhelming power of thought, we may expect
to find amongst us the compassionate, the gentle, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
loving, and those give the plastic material which will
yield itself to the fingers of the Manu to be moulded into
a new type, a higher evolution. Hence, from time to time
the great shakings that take place to shake out those who
are too purely intellectual, and who do not think the word
Brotherhood is a word that ought to be heard so much
amongst us. The Masters have chosen Brotherhood as
our mark, and we cannot march in Their army if we will
not bear Their sign. And so, if mind makes us too self-assertive,
too sure of our own superiority, then we must
be shaken out of this movement. So do not in this immediate
future be troubled if we still continue to go along
our own quiet road of attracting the loving and the gentle
rather than those who are mighty in their intellectual
power. The thing of vital importance is the Spirit of
Brotherhood, and that we must never let go. And remember,
in the whole of the struggles of the future, as
in those of the past, that they must always rage round
persons, and those who think more of personalities than
of principles are inevitably shaken out. If you make a
person’s presence or absence a reason for being in or out
of the Society, you are showing the spirit of separation,
which cannot realise a principle, but thinks only of the
passing and transient personality. What can it matter
whether any one of you agrees or disagrees with Mr.
Leadbeater, or with Mr. Mead, or with anyone else?
These are all persons. The principle of the Society remain
unshaken. Presidents are elected and Presidents
die, but the Society goes on. What folly, then, to give up
a place in a mighty movement because the person temporarily
at the head of it is a person who does not exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
fit into the shape you have made as your own particular
ideal. It does not matter. The Society is not bound by
its President any more than by anyone else. It is bound
only by its great central principle of Brotherhood. And
so all of you who have stood through the past shaking
have shown that you care more for principles than for
persons, and it does not matter whether, so to speak,
you have agreed or disagreed with the President so long
as you have stood firm within the Society; for there
lies the principle, whilst the other is only personality.
Cling, then, to that principle to which you have clung
through the past storm; recognise that whether a person
be right or wrong, noble or ignoble, great or small, that
is a matter of secondary importance. The work of the
future lies in the movement, and not in the hands of any
particular individual who may happen to be here.
Whether you or I come back to this great movement
in other lives depends on ourselves, and not on the
opinion that anyone else may happen to have about us.
None can throw us out of it if we are worthy to remain
in it; none can keep us in it if we are unworthy to be
part of it. And realising kārmic law, realising the
greatness of the movement and its work in the future,
let us join hands, whether we agree or disagree with each
other on any other matter save that of Brotherhood, and
go forward into the future that is unfolding before us,
brighter than ever the past has shone; go forward to the
making of the sub-race out of which the Root Race shall
spring, under the banner of our Manu and our Bodhisattva,
the mighty Ones of years and millennia to come.</p>

<h3 id="II_Lecture_III">Lecture III<br />
<span class="smaller">The Catholic and Puritan Spirit in the
Theosophical Society<br />
The Value and Danger of Each</span></h3>

<p>I want to try to trace out the somewhat difficult subject
of the place of the Puritan and the Catholic Spirit in our
Society. I want to show that both types are necessary
in every great movement; that both have their value and
place, yet also their dangers. And if we realise that
both are necessary, it may help each type to be tolerant
as regards the other, and to see that each has its dangers.</p>

<p>Now, all the world over these two types are found;
they are, in fact, two marked temperaments, intellectual
and emotional, into which, roughly, you might throw
almost all thoughtful and educated people, and even the
thoughtless and ignorant, for those also will show similar
types, although naturally less attractively, because more
extreme, than they may be among the class of people who
at least are seeking to understand themselves, and to gain
some measure of equilibrium. Looked at from the outside,
the Catholic type is certainly the more attractive,
and therefore I want to impress upon you the value of
the Puritan type; because, being less attractive, its value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
is more likely to be overlooked. If the Puritan spirit
were completely lost, mankind would lack that vigour and
strength and tendency to free thought and free judgment
which are so essential to human evolution. Unfortunately,
it has often been united with a very cold and forbidding
exterior; and if we take the two types as we find
them in the reign of Charles I., certainly the Puritan is
not very attractive from outside—hard, rather sour, forbidding,
and austere. But it is not quite fair to judge the
Puritan by that type in the reign of the Stuarts. It is
not fair to pick out a type at the moment where these two
difficulties face it—danger to itself, and the extreme evil
of the type it is opposing. It is hardly fair to take that
moment for a judgment of the value of the temperament
in itself. But even if you take the Puritan of the time
of Charles I. and Cromwell, you can hardly help noticing,
if you go beyond externals, the extreme moral value of
that type amid those difficult and dangerous surroundings.
Austere as it was, it was the austerity that was
trying to guard itself against continual danger of pollution,
and naturally it ran into extremes, as all reactions
run, with the inevitable result that another reaction followed
on the first, and you had the loose and profligate
type of the Court of Charles II. It is the types I want
to disentangle from these special manifestations, and,
looking at them apart, from all conditions that may
emphasise one characteristic or another.</p>

<p>Now, in what does the Puritan type exactly consist?
It seems to consist in an attitude of protest and criticism
rather than of ready acceptance of the prevailing thought
of the time. The Puritan mind is essentially critical, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
critical in the modern sense of the term, which, instead
of making the critic a judge, makes him an opponent
and condemner. We must remember, however, that the
true critical spirit is absolutely necessary for human
progress, even though it often slips into condemnation
and cynicism. The Puritan is always intellectual (I am
speaking of the purer type), a man in whom mind is predominant.
He is of the type that tends to separation
rather than unity; he stands alone, sufficient for himself
(I say that rather than “self-sufficient,” the second form
connoting a rather unpleasant quality). We must realise
the strength of this type. The strength may slip into
austerity, but that very largely grows out of the religion
to which the Puritan may happen to be attached. You
do not find him in his more aggressive form unless he is
protesting against something he regards as dangerous
and mischievous. Naturally, under these considerations
he is thrown into the attitude of combat, and hence all
that is harshest and most hostile inevitably comes to the
surface. But that is not a necessary part of the Puritan
spirit. Looking at him as the intellectual man in whom
emotion in this particular life is comparatively weak, or
if not weak, repressed; seeing that in him the mental
qualities are those which in this incarnation he specially
endeavours to develop; understanding that the mind can
only be developed where the qualities of analysing, comparing,
and judging are active, you can readily see how,
in the face of opposition, these qualities would turn into
antagonism and protest. But I do not think antagonism
and protest are a necessary part of the Puritan spirit. In
peaceful times your Puritan would be distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
rather as the analytical or intellectual man, most valuable
to any community into which he may be thrown at the
time. For you cannot develop the mind without developing
these analysing qualities: synthesis comes later, the
one belonging to the lower, the other to the higher
Manas. Both need to be developed. While the lower
Manas is developing, you must have these qualities of
analysis, comparison, and judgment without which it is
not possible to lay a strong foundation for any belief.
You must recognise the utter necessity for the challenging,
questioning, even doubting and sceptical spirit.
Only by means of this can error be detected, and the traditions
that come down from the past be gradually purified
of the accretions that have come to them during
the ignorant periods through which they may have
passed. To be sceptical is no fault, but rather a virtue.
If there is to be progress at all, there must be challenging
of that which has come down from the past, so that,
testing, analysing, criticising, you may be able to separate
the truth from the error. How would religion become
ever more and more spiritual if men are only to inherit,
and never to examine and understand? And since no
religion or other form of thought can ever come down
through centuries without picking up a large amount of
error, if we had not this critical and challenging spirit all
religions would grow into superstitions, and that which is
most valuable for the race would gradually be covered
under a mass of ignorant error. Hence at certain times
in the history of the race a great outburst of the Puritan
spirit is necessary. That alone will bring about fundamental
changes, religious, moral, and social; that alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
has the courage to go forward whilst in a minority, and
test with the test of reason every belief and every tradition.
We must not, then, blind ourselves to the immense
value of this spirit in the intellectual development of man.
For always, inasmuch as religious and social order has
come by some great Teacher enormously beyond his
own generation in religious, moral, and social development,
inevitably his teachings, handed down generation
after generation, will in many respects tend to be covered
with superstition.</p>

<p>Let us pause for a moment and see what the word
“superstition” means. I do not think I can give a better
definition than my old one: “superstition is the taking of
the non-essential as the essential.” I think that you will
find that that covers all the cases which you would call
superstitions—a truth originally; but in every truth there
are necessary and accessory parts. As the understanding
of the truth is clouded, the accessories take on too
large a value in the minds of people, until at last the
accessory is everything and the essential nothing.</p>

<p>I told once an Indian story which marks out clearly
what is superstition. There was once a very holy man
in the habit of offering a sacrifice by pouring butter into
the fire—one of the ordinary Hindū ceremonies.
Morning after morning he duly performed this rite. He
was much admired by his neighbours, and the regularity
of the discharge of his religious duties led them to consider
him a model worthy of imitation. This good man
happened to have a cat. As he was kindly-hearted and
affectionate, the cat loved him, and used to come up and
interrupt his religious service; so he put a collar round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the cat and tied it to the bedpost to prevent interruptions.
Time went on, a few generations passed, and
then all of the people who copied this admirable saint
not only offered the sacrifice, but also considered it a
part of the rite to have a cat tied to the bedpost. Still
more time went on, until at last all that remained of the
original ceremony was the cat tied to the bedpost and
nothing else. Now there is superstition: the harmless
accessory had become necessary, until it occupied the
whole of the worshippers’ minds. This is often the case
in religions which have lasted long, and have had many
ignorant adherents. They cannot distinguish between
the inner meaning and the outer form; and gradually the
outer form becomes everything, and the inner meaning
disappears. Then comes the time when, superstition
having taken the place of truth, there rises up the critical
intellect of man, attacks the whole, and challenges the
authority. Only sometimes the critic is not evolved
enough to recognise the truth at the same time that he
wars against the error. More often he takes the whole
as superstition and tries to destroy it completely. There
you have the history of many reformations. Take the
great Reformation of the sixteenth century. If you look
back to that you will see that an enormous amount of
valuable truth was thrown aside in trying to get rid of
the surface error with which the truth had been covered.
And so in tracing down the growth of the Puritan spirit
from the time of Luther, through Calvinistic Switzerland,
up to Scotland with John Knox, and then looking
at it as it spread over England, and became so powerful
under James I. and Charles I., you will recognise that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the whole of that there is a gradual throwing away of
everything that the mind could not grasp and understand,
and consequently a great loss of the spiritual side of
things. The result of that historically has been that the
truth that was thrown away in the getting rid of the
error came back again a little later. And so with certain
fundamental tendencies in man, against which the Puritan
of that time set himself utterly—the use of images
in public worship, the use of music, the use of garments
different from the everyday garments, and so on—all
these points that he threw aside as part of the Papal
abomination came back again, slowly, steadily, gradually
spreading through the whole of the Anglican Church.
So that you have this remarkable object-lesson, which
it would be well for all Puritan-spirited people to
remember. You may visit a cathedral to-day. Outside
the cathedral you will see the statues which were broken
by Cromwell’s soldiery; and inside the cathedral, on or
round the high altar and chancel, you will see the
modern statues placed there in order to help the devotional
spirit in the congregation.</p>

<p>I have purposely taken the Puritan spirit outside the
Theosophical Society so that you may look at it apart
from any special question of interest to our own Society.
If you see the value of that in religion, you will welcome
its presence in the Theosophical Society. You will
realise that that spirit is wanted in order to balance
and keep in check what might otherwise be the excess
of the Catholic spirit. You will realise that our critical
friends are doing us an immense service in their criticism,
and that it only becomes mischievous when the critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
spirit grows into antagonism and dislike, which need not
at all accompany it, and should not accompany it in a
well-balanced and thoughtful mind. We must have that
spirit amongst us, otherwise the enthusiastic will run
away too rapidly and fall into error. The chill that
sometimes it causes is a very valuable element for mental
growth. We do not want to have nothing but chill—that
will prevent growth altogether; but if we were
more tolerant with each other, then we might have the
advantage of the chill, which would keep the intellectual
atmosphere clear and sharp, without having the very
life chilled out of us by criticism.</p>

<p>Let us now pause on what we mean by the Catholic
spirit. By that I mean the spirit which is reverent of
tradition, which is willing to submit to reasonable and
recognised authority, which is willing to take a great
plan and co-operate in it, and realise that the presence
of the architect of the plan, if He be a person highly
developed, say a Master, is enough to give it authority,
and that there is no lack of freedom or dignity in
accepting the plan of a greater, and working it out to
the utmost of one’s ability. It is the spirit which, largely
emotional, when it rises into love of the higher and
becomes devotion, causes sympathetic vibrations on the
buddhic plane, and so begins the awakening of the Spirit
above the intellect. Again, with this Catholic spirit
you always find the love of beauty. It is artistic. It
seeks to clothe thought in forms of beauty. It loves
ceremonial, takes a pleasure in harmonised expression
of thought, and desires that everything round it should
be emotionally satisfactory as well as intellectually sound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Moreover, its mind is eminently teachable, where the
Puritan is not. Hence it is far easier to lead it along
the path of what is called Occultism. The Catholic
mind very readily recognises that those above itself in
development may be able by guidance and teaching to
help it to reach knowledge which, unaided, it would be
unable to achieve. The Puritan would walk alone; the
Catholic would utilise every assistance that can be given
in evolution, including the assistance of human beings
more highly developed, as well as of spiritual intelligences.
And so you have round it an atmosphere which
readily responds to impulses from the spiritual worlds,
and always with this spirit you find the tendency toward
Occultism of various kinds. I do not think you ever
find that tendency in connexion with the Puritan spirit.
You may find with the Puritan spirit sometimes a lofty
form of mysticism, a recognition of a Spirit as the Life
of the universe, and an attempt to realise that Spirit
within oneself. That you may reach largely by way of
the intellect, and emotion is not necessarily concerned
in it. Intellectually you may realise unity, and then
pass into the mystical ideal of the One in the Many, to
be recognised in each. And you do find occasionally in
the great Puritans of the past a very noble, though
somewhat stern and cold, form of mystical belief;
whereas the moment you come to Catholic mysticism, you
find yourself in an atmosphere charged with emotion.
The Catholic Mystic is swept up in a great surge of
emotion to the Object of his love; the Puritan Mystic
calmly, almost coldly, recognises the greatness of the
Object of his worship, intellectually tries to realise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
by that to some extent unifies himself with It. You
have an example of the Puritan Mystic in Cromwell.
Read his letters, read the letters of the man, wrung out
of his heart by the strain of doubt and despair, and clinging,
in spite of all temptation, to his belief in the reality
of a Divine Power whose instrument he was. You will
rise from that reading with a new idea of the strength of
the man, and realise that with all that strength there
was the recognition of the strength of God and of his
own strength as being only an instrument in the divine
hands. But you never find the Puritan Mystic the expression
of love, of passionate affection, that are so
common among the Catholic Mystics; and more than
anything else is the difference marked when you come to
deal with Occultism.</p>

<p>And there, in our own Society, is a point we ought to
pause upon. The Catholic type amongst us will be one
that will readily respond to the idea of the Masters, the
Puritan less quickly. The Catholic mind in the Theosophist
will not only recognise the ideal of the Masters,
but will be fired with a desire to tread the path that
They have trodden. There will be a looking up of reverence,
an outstretching of the hand for guidance; a
realisation that by that dependence more rapid progress
may be made than along any other line. That which is
invisible will exercise a potent attraction; he will always
be trying to know something of the invisible worlds and
their inhabitants, he will always be reaching out toward
these worlds and trying to expand his consciousness into
communication with them. He will be willing to train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
himself with that in view, and you will have in him the
possibility of the Occultist which you will not find in the
Puritan type. For you cannot begin this part of occult
knowledge along the purely intellectual lines. The intellectual
exertion will check at once the evolution of the
other vehicles. The moment you begin to think: “What
am I doing? Is it imagination? Is it hallucination?”
you check the growth of the subtler faculties of the man.
You are obliged for a time to go on without questions,
feeling, sensing, groping, and refusing to allow the mind
to come in with its analysing spirit, that chills everything
down so much that these budding faculties, as it were,
shrink back from the touch of the frost, refusing to
unfold. “Well,” you say, “there is a danger. The person
may become overcredulous, may be utterly led
astray.” True. It is the necessary danger of all such
research. Only step by step do you learn by experience
to distinguish between the true and false, between the
thought-forms created by yourself and the inhabitants
of other worlds into which you are penetrating with
half-opened eyes. But remember that distinguishing
does not do away with the reality of the thought-form.
Your own thought-forms which surround you when
you first pass on to the astral plane are real forms in
astral matter. They deceive you, yes, because they are
your own creations, and only give you back the things
you are thinking about. They repeat to you your own
thoughts, and there lies the element of danger. But you
can only outgrow that by experience, exactly in the same
way that the baby learns that it cannot catch hold of the
glittering thing at the end of the room, but, to reach it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
must cover a great deal of space. You do not think it
heartbreaking because the baby makes mistakes. You
are content that he shall learn. Why not be as philosophical
about yourselves? You know that they will grow
out of their ignorance by experience. So will you. Those
who always want to be right are people who will never
make Occultists. The Occultist must be ready to plunge
forward, and possibly tumble into a bog, but be ready to
go on again afterwards, learning by experience to understand.
Those who will not face this have not enough of
the Catholic spirit to make Occultists, and had better
leave it for another incarnation.</p>

<p>There is another danger, one especially seen here—the
dependence upon another. I have often been asked:
“How can you develop independence and judgment if
you are always trying to do the will of another, whom
you call your Master?” The answer is simple. You
look to your Master for direction, and He may point you
to some work to be done. You take the work because
He told you to do it. So far you are the obedient servant;
but your judgment, your reason, all your thought-power,
all your initiative, are taxed to the utmost in the
achievement of the task. A sensible Occultist never goes
running to his Master and asking, “How shall I do
this?” He knows that is not the Master’s work. The
Master has done His part in saying “Do that.” How
you do it tests you, and brings out your strength and
weakness. And the Master is far too wise to prevent
your bringing out your strength and discovering your
weakness by doing for you what He has told you to do.
Hence the Occultist develops all his faculties in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
attempt to do his Master’s will. The two things work
well together, and he does not become weak but strong
in realising that the Master is greater than he, and
knows far better the plan of the work, while he himself,
in carrying out his own portion of it, finds full employment
for every faculty of brain and heart.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible for the typical Puritan to become
an Occultist in the life in which this side is being
so strongly developed. You cannot understand everything
when you go into unknown worlds; and unless you
are willing to be ignorant, there is no possibility of discovering
new knowledge. Every pioneer of science—to
quote, I think, Faraday—“runs about like a dog with
his nose to the ground, trying to find out a trail.” That
is exactly the way of the experimenter. You must search
for yourself for the trace which will guide you to the
desired knowledge; and if you will not do that, you must
take the results of others, and be content with these
results for this life.</p>

<p>But, now, how will these two types of spirit work
when they come to, say, such a question as that of Mr.
Leadbeater? You will have at once the working of
the critical intelligence which sees faults more readily
than virtues, and bad motives more readily than good.
That is its weakness. But it also has its value in pointing
out certain dangers into which the Society might otherwise
slip. The Catholic spirit will be far more ready to
take it for granted that one from whom they have
learned much, whom they know to have far vaster knowledge
than their own, may have some other reason which
they do not see, which would justify to the doer what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
he has done, and they do not feel that curious sense
that they must save their neighbours’ souls, whether
their neighbours desire it or not. They are content to
say, “This is my road, that is his”—a wider and more
generous spirit. Nevertheless, I think we should do well
also to recognise that the presence in the Society of
the critical and even judging spirit has at some times its
value. But it is not a foundation on which anything can
be built, and that is sometimes forgotten. You cannot
build an enduring edifice on the grounds of protest
against someone else. It cannot endure. It is curious to
notice that the same people who condemn personality
when the tendency of the personality is love and devotion,
are the people who show personality most strongly
when they antagonise and dislike. I admit to the full
that principle should guide, not personality; but I cannot
admit that a love for a personality is wrong, whilst
a hatred of a personality is right and admirable. Both
may put persons above principles if the two come into
clash. And it is putting a personality above a principle
when you desert the Theosophical Society, forgetting
the great principles which make it immortal, and
leave it, protesting against it, because one or two people
hold views with which you do not agree. It is the
<i lang="la">ne plus ultra</i> of personality. Mr. Leadbeater and Mrs.
Besant are both comparatively old, and cannot at the
most live very long. What utter folly, then, to desert
the great principles incarnated in the Society because of
the antagonism of two transitory personalities! If
Theosophy be anything at all, then it is everything in
life, and is not to be given up for anyone, whether saint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
or criminal. Suppose a hundred murderers were members
of the Society, is that any reason why you or I
should go out of it? It seems to me that the fact that
we disapprove of that so much is a reason for staying in
the Society, in order to strengthen it in the hour of its
peril and to carry it through.</p>

<p>We need in the whole of this to study our own nature
first, and find out our weak points, and then to guard
against that weakness in the time of storm and stress.
And we need, more than that, to realise that very often
when people oppose us, they oppose us because of their
virtues, and not because of their vices. That is, that
the people who are utterly against me now are against
me because of their virtues. They are wrong in the view
they take—they misconstrue; that does not matter. But
the fundamental reason why they oppose is because they
believe that I am condoning what is wrong. That is a
good feeling and right. But it is not right when it goes
into hatred and calumny, when people go about telling
abominable stories of all kinds which are utterly false,
using them as weapons to injure. But, none the less, the
beginning lay in a virtue—the desire to guard the Society
from harm; and that ought to be recognised even when
it has run into excess. If we can do that, then, in the
midst of struggle, we shall be learning the true Theosophical
spirit, which sees the good first, and only
recognises the excess afterwards. And my suggestion is:
“Train yourself, in your ordinary thinking, to see first
the good of a person or thing, and only afterwards allow
yourself to see the weakness or evil.” Then you will get
all the good of your critical spirit, and be guarded against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
much harm. But if you see the bad side first, you are
likely not to see the good side at all. These things test
our members, and show whether we are fit to go along
this great path or not—show whether we are ready to be
part of that great Sixth Race which is coming, or
whether we are so wedded to our own opinions that outside
those we can see nothing good.</p>

<p>The trouble is practically over, but we should remember
its lessons—a wider tolerance, a sterner self-criticism,
and a more charitable attitude towards our fellows.
You cannot be too hard in criticising yourself, nor too
tolerant and charitable towards your neighbour. Remember
that in every one of us the Self is endeavouring
to express something of himself. In our own case we
have the right to criticise every obstacle put in the way
of His manifestation, to be hard in our judgment of ourselves,
pitiless in our condemnation of our every fault
and weakness. But we cannot govern the manifestation
of the Self in another; hence our criticism is useless and
impertinent—does not help, but hinders; for if the other
person is wrong, as you think he is, then your harsh
judgment makes an added barrier in his way when the
Self in him is trying to guide him back to the right,
whereas your charity, your tolerant respect, will help
him to realise the noblest in him. Hence the lesson of
this great shaking should be criticism of ourselves and
charity to all around us. Recognition of our own type,
clear self-judgment, so that we may walk aright and
help others as much as may be; and, above all, so to
purify our own characters that we may be channels for
the life that flows in the Society, and may not soil it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
it passes through ourselves. The Society can never die
by attacks from without, nor by desertions from within;
it can only die when its members are careless of their
own thought, their own character, their own ideas; that,
and that alone, can make the Society unworthy of the
guidance of its Teachers. It was once said: “So long as
three men remain in the Society worthy of our Lord’s
blessing it cannot perish.” That was a word spoken by
a Master in the days when the Society was weak and
struggling, and when the few people that belonged to it
feared it would never survive the storm that shook it in
the time of the Coulomb attack. Think of that if any
other storm should approach us—although we are not
likely now to have another for the next twelve years;
but when a storm comes, remember that inspiring idea,
that as long as three remain in the Society it cannot
perish; and add to that the vow registered by the Higher
Self: “If others depart, I will be one of the three.”</p>

<span class="smaller">The Sacramental Life</span></h3>

<p>I am to speak to you to-night on a subject of deep interest
to those who regard the religions of the world
from the standpoint of Occultism. In all the great religions
we find what are called “sacraments,” to take the
Western name; and in all religions the object is the
same—the endeavour to spiritualise the ordinary life of
man; to make it possible for men and women living in
the world, blinded by their bodies, unable to rise above
the material limitations—to enable those men and women
to come into direct touch with higher worlds and higher
beings, and so, from the definite sacramental act, to pass
on until the whole life may become a sacrament by the
radiation of spiritual life through the material coating.</p>

<p>Now different religions have different numbers of
sacraments, although the essence remains the same. In
Hindūism the sacraments are very numerous. Ten are
recognised as of universal application, but the number
will run up to thirty or forty if you take all the ceremonies
that are distinctly recognised as having this
character among the more orthodox Hindūs. The number,
after all, is immaterial; it is the fundamental idea
which is important. As knowledge of the meaning of
the sacraments spreads, especially in the Western world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
it will be found that many things that have been put
aside as superstitious will come back with a new light
and power. Certain ideas which were cast aside at the
period of the Reformation were thrown aside rather
by reaction than for any defensible reason. The way
in which many of the thoughts and dogmas of the
Roman Catholic Church were pressed among the
people, the widespread ignorance of meanings while
forms were carefully observed, not unnaturally brought
about a powerful reaction when reason began to challenge
the ceremonies. As occult knowledge had practically
fallen into the background among the great mass
of the Roman Catholic priesthood, there came rejection
of that which could not be rationally explained. As
we are able to see the justification for very much that
then was rejected, however, we realise that many of
these things will come back. And if we think, it is not
unnatural that these should return. Going back to the
early days of religion (I am thinking now of Christianity,
but it is the same in all the great religions), we find the
Founder and his immediate disciples who shape and
mould the religion. As these men were men to whom the
spiritual world was familiar, and as their duty was to
make bridges between the ordinary mass of men and the
great spiritual teachings of religion, it was inevitable
that in the forms of worship laid down by them there
should be in the background occult truths. Hence we
find in the early Church the great institution of the Mysteries;
and I shall want, later on, to show the relation
between the Mystery, the Sacrament, and the great legend
of the Holy Grail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now consider what a sacrament really is. I do
not think we can get a better definition than in the
Catechism of the Anglican Church: “An outward and
visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace”—something
that is outer, tangible, that the senses can appreciate, a
material object; then, with that, indissolubly connected,
certain facts of the invisible world, so that the outer sign
is able to act as a channel for the inner reality. But
also, under the heading of “outward and visible sign,”
you want something beyond the material object; you
want a material gesture and material words. These
three things are always present in a sacrament; some
material object which is the immediate channel, certain
sounds or words which make a change in the subtle
material mingled with the denser material of that object,
and a gesture called often the “sign of power,” as the
words are called “words of power.” Now the gesture
must be one through which magnetism can be thrown
on to the object which is affected by the words.</p>

<p>Let us see how those facts are bound together in the
sacrament itself, and what is their connexion with the
constitution of man and of the worlds in which he lives.
The worlds with which the man is connected, for our
present purpose, we can take as the physical, astral,
mental—the three worlds in which turns the wheel of
births and death. He is in those three—either in all of
them together, as when in the physical world; in two of
them, as when in the astral world; in one only when in
the heavenly world. For remember that only in the
physical world are the three bodies available that connect
him with all of the three at the same time. In these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
three worlds, then, man is continually living. He is
related to them by his physical body, astral body, and
mental body, so that you have a living intelligence, a
spiritual being, who, by means of the matter that he has
appropriated in these three worlds, is able to come into
contact with each of them. But now arises the question:
Given a spiritual intelligence clothed in this triple veil of
matter; given the fact that that spiritual intelligence, by
the veil of matter, is in contact with three worlds—how
shall he be able to come gradually into conscious connexion
with each, so that the stream of spiritual life,
coming down from the spiritual world, may at once
purify the matter of his bodies, illuminate his consciousness
in these three stages, and so begin the great work
of spiritualising the whole man? That is the problem
that religion has had to solve. So far as ordinary Protestantism
is concerned, the body has been cast aside as a
very temporary possession, only occupied by the spiritual
intelligence during one brief life, and hardly worth
troubling about. Hence the body has become very much
neglected from the ordinary standpoint of Protestantism,
and the reaction against that has taken the form of
materialism, so that you find people rejecting the view of
the worthlessness of the body, and falling into a materialism
in which the body is made the most important
thing. Instead of that, in the earlier days of the great
faiths, the body was regarded as a valuable possession,
a thing to be made holy, to be sanctified, in order that
it might be a fitting instrument of the spiritual intelligence
therein embodied.</p>

<p>And so, in all these earlier days of religions, continual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
relationships were being made, first between the spiritual
world and the lower worlds, and then between the
embodied intelligence and the bodies that that intelligence
is wearing. Hence the sacraments which should
touch both body and consciousness, which should sanctify
the material vehicles while illuminating the spiritual
intelligence, which should make the whole man really
spiritual in order that the object of incarnation might
be accomplished—that matter in all the worlds should
be rendered the obedient servant of Spirit. That was
the object of the sacrament. Hence the necessity for the
material object in order that it may come into touch with
the dense body. Hence the need of the signs in order
that, by the vibrations set up, sent on to subtler planes,
the subtler bodies might be set vibrating, and be able
to receive the downfall of spiritual life. Hence also the
need for the gesture, so that the magnetic force sent out
in the consecration might link together the denser and
the subtler matter by this bond of magnetism, and in
that way might make the whole of the material object a
vehicle for the higher life while preparing the bodies
for the reception of that downflow.</p>

<p>Now let us, in order to work out these principles, take
the sacrament of Baptism. In this you know that you
have the whole of these three conditions of a sacrament
present—water, the material object; the words of
power; the consecration of the water. You have the
words of consecration, praying God to sanctify this
water to the mystical washing away of sin; and then
you have the sign of power—the cross made over the
water—in order that the magnetism from the fingers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the priest may magnetise it, and be the link between the
physical water and the astral matter which interpenetrates
it.</p>

<p>I pause for a moment on the phrase “words of power.”
The whole understanding and use of such words depends
on the fact that every sound causes certain definite
vibrations. Wherever there is a sound there is a correlated
vibration. Now a mantra, or word of power, is
a certain definite succession of sounds made by an Occultist
in order to bring about certain definite results.
That is as much a scientific fact as a fact that none of you
would challenge—that you can by producing a musical
note set up vibrations in a glass or rod or string which
is sympathetic. You remember the experiments of Tyndall.
He would show how by a certain sound you could
shiver a piece of glass. What really happens? The glass
begins to vibrate. As the vibrations are made by the
note, it repeats them; if it is more than the glass can
respond to, the particles are torn asunder and the glass
is broken. Exactly a similar line of thought conducts
you to the use and meaning of the mantra. The Occultist
tries certain sounds. He finds out what are the
sounds that bring about the vibrations that he desires.
Having discovered that experimentally, he puts those
sounds into a definite order and then gives a sentence
which will reproduce that sequence of sounds whenever
the sentence is uttered. This sequence of sounds
causes vibrations, which in their turn set up vibrations
in the subtle bodies. The more the mantra is repeated,
the more powerful the result. Hence the use of repetition
that you find so much in Church formulæ. Hence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
use of the rosary, so that you may not have the jar of
counting in producing the vibrations that you require.
Now it is obvious that a mantra cannot be translated
without losing part of its power. It may still have a
power from the thought which is in it, but the sequence
of sounds is affected. Hence the special value of the
mantra apart from the thought which the words embody.
Hence the wisdom of the Greek and Roman Catholic
Churches in using their words of power as given by the
Occultists who devised them. Unfortunately, in the Reformation,
occult knowledge being at a discount, it
was thought you could translate the words of power
without losing the effect. You keep the effect caused by
the thought; you lose a very large part of the mechanical
effect caused by the sounds. What is lost of ordinary
mechanical effect has to be brought about by devotion
or will-power; whereas if you produce the vibrations
mechanically, you then have all your devotion and will-power
left undiminished to bring about the higher results.
There is the value of the scientific ways of dealing
with the bodies. It is not a question of consciousness
now, but of the bodies, and only secondarily of the effect
on the consciousness of the vibrations of the bodies;
yet that also cannot be left out. Just as a change in consciousness
brings about a certain vibration, so does a vibration
bring about a corresponding change in consciousness.
Hence to set up right vibrations helps the consciousness
to remain in a certain condition, and we
naturally find that in the Greek and Roman Catholic
Churches the effects produced by the words of the sacrament
are greater than these produced in Churches where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the words of power are translated. One advantage that
comes out of that is that, in the first case, where the priest
is using the words that themselves make the vibrations,
the man’s character, devotion, and knowledge are not as
important as they are in the case where the mechanical
effect is lost, and the priest must supply by his own devotion
and will-power that which could be more readily produced
by the mantra. It is out of that that has come the
statement that the unworthiness of the priest does not
destroy the worth of the sacrament. Certainly it is not as
potent where the priest is unworthy, but where the mechanism
is perfect, the worker not being perfect is less
important.</p>

<p>Now if a clairvoyant watches what is done when a
sacrament is taking place, he sees that on the repetition
of the words of consecration and the making of the sign
of power a visible change occurs in the consecrated object.
It is most marked if we turn to the Mass, or Holy
Communion. You have there on the altar the sacred elements—the
bread and the wine. According to the Roman
Catholic doctrine, at the words of power, what is called
“transubstantiation” takes place. That teaching has been
very much misunderstood by the ordinary Protestant.
He does not realise that in every visible object there is
an invisible and formative idea; that that idea, working
along ordinary lines, produces one of the ordinary objects
that you see around you; but that if the idea be
changed by the use of a word of power, a mantra, that
that change of the idea produces a change of astral matter,
and in the etheric and even dense physical matter
also a change of vibration is set up. And although it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
true that in the densest matter the vibration is not powerful
enough to alter the arrangement of the particles, it is
true that in all the most important part of that object
a change has occurred, and it is that change which is indicated
by the word “transubstantiation.” No instructed
Roman Catholic ever was foolish enough to think anything
save that which I am now putting to you. Now if
that idea seems strange, let me remind you of a simple
fact which will throw light on the whole thing. Students
of organic chemistry are familiar with isometric compounds.
Those compounds are made up of exactly the
same number of the same chemical elements. Nevertheless,
the chemist will tell you that according to the inner
arrangement of those elements will be the qualities of the
thing. You may have in some of the higher carbon compounds
(even so low down as where you have entering
into the base only four carbon atoms) an arrangement or
rearrangement of those elements such as to give you entirely
different qualities—in one case a poison, in the
other harmless. That change of arrangement makes all
the difference. Is it so strange, then, that in changing the
inner arrangement the qualities change? In the invisible
worlds these things can be seen, so that that piece of
opaque bread, when the words are spoken, utterly
changes in appearance, becoming luminous and shining
out in every direction. Now the moment one sees that,
one begins to realise what a sacrament means from the
material standpoint. You are dealing with an object that
can be changed in its qualities. You are reconstituting
the subtle portions of that by the forces you are bringing
to bear on it. With what object? In order that, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the planes above the mental, spiritual power pouring
down may find a vehicle which is able to assimilate it
and carry it down to the densest plane of matter, and
by that vehicle may be passed on to those who are
partakers of the sacrament. And not only do you see
that change appearing in the elements, but you see also
that that change draws to the altar numbers of those
whom the Hindūs call Devas, and the Christians call
Angels, who lend their powers to the helping of the
worshippers, and change the atmosphere of the whole
place to which they throng.</p>

<p>Now the moment anyone sees this, he realises that
much has to come back to some of the religious sects of
the West in order to make them what they ought to be.
And the result of losing sight of all this inner part of the
Christian ceremonies, rites, and formulæ has been the
tendency to grow more and more materialistic, until you
find that the ordinary Protestant knows of nothing as
between himself and God, nothing of the work of all that
mighty hierarchy of spiritual intelligences who form the
ladder between earth and heaven. Hence the gradual
disappearance from the modern mind of the teaching of
the ministry of Angels. How much of it has slipped out
of knowledge, and how much all life has lost of beauty
by the passing away of these links between the higher
and lower worlds. When a person takes the sacrament,
you have there the actual physical touch all along the
material lines, a real purification of the body as well as
illumination of the intelligence. But you may say:
“Does it all turn on this outward ceremony—these words
and signs?” No. There is, in addition to that, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
consciousness of the worshipper, a tremendous potency
which assimilates that which pours down from the higher
worlds. And although it be true that that potency is
very much more readily assimilated when all the material
coverings have been tuned and made ready to receive it,
none the less is it also true that even where that part of
the sacrament is wanting it is a veritable means of grace
to those who realise the inner meaning, although not
understanding the importance of the outer form. I think
that there is little doubt that, as Occultism spreads, this
will all come back to the Churches; for it is part of the
Theosophical mission to restore that which has been
lost, to bring to knowledge again that which has been
forgotten.</p>

<p>And there are also other things in relation to this
which will come into modern life again as the truth of
the sacrament is recognised. So many discussions there
have been about the Apostolic Succession, the passing of
power from one to another by a sacrament, not recognised
as a sacrament in some part of the Anglican
Church, but recognised by the Roman Catholic Church as
the Sacrament of Holy Orders. There, again, a physical
passing of magnetism; there, again, a definite succession,
a hierarchy which is an image of the hierarchy in higher
worlds. For always religions have reflexions of the
realities of the higher worlds, and these reflexions have
their power and their use. Now, in the ordinary Protestant
community, and even in the great Anglican Church
itself, only two sacraments are normally recognised—the
sacrament of the altar and that of the font. Outside
those, as you know, the Greek and Roman Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Churches have others in addition to that of Holy Orders
above mentioned—all of them, from the standpoint of
the sacramental life, important. They have the Sacrament
of Confirmation; but that ought surely to be recognised
as a sacrament everywhere, for you have there
the essential parts of the sacrament and the conveying
of a spiritual power. So also they have the Sacrament
of Penance, in which the spiritual power is again conveyed
which enables the penitent by effort and repentance
to regain spiritual strength when it has been injured
by sin. So you have also the Sacrament of Matrimony,
and the loss of the sacramental side of marriage
has led very largely to its degradation in Protestant countries.
So also the Sacrament of Extreme Unction, which
is, curiously enough, coming back among Protestants.
Look at the accounts of the Guilds of Healing established
in the Church—no less than three in the Anglican
community. They have restored the sacramental use of
oil, founding themselves upon a passage in the New Testament:
“Is any sick, let him call the elders of the church,
and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the
name of the Lord”—a sacramental act. You have the oil
as the vehicle of the magnetism, the name of the Lord as
the word of power, and in putting on the oil ever the sign
of the Cross is used. Now it is a very significant thing
that that has been brought back definitely by members of
the Anglican Church, priests and laity, to-day; and one
wonders very much why in the Roman Catholic community,
with the occult knowledge of its leaders, it has
that use of sacramental oil only at the death-moment,
when its great value cannot be utilised. That is one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the points I cannot quite make out in studying the
ritual of the Roman Catholic Church.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Now, supposing that you recognise that fact of a
sacrament, how would it affect your ordinary daily life?
It would gradually discipline your mind to realise that
all life is sacramental, rightly understood; that every
outer action should be connected with a spiritual truth;
and in this way all your actions would cease to be hindrances,
and would tend to become helpers. Among the
Hindūs this is largely recognised, for all the great actions
of the daily life with them are sacramental. Every
true Hindū, on waking, prays that as his eyes open to
the light of the day, so his Spirit may open to the light
of the inner Self. In his daily bath, as he pours the water
over his body, his prayer is, that as the water washes the
body, so may the mind be cleansed and the heart purified.
All the bodily actions are consecrated as the reflexions
of the spiritual life, and the effect of that is to
make a disciplined, self-controlled, balanced character.
The daily training gradually makes the whole life orderly;
and it is not without significance that in the religions
where the sacramental life is realised, there it is
that you find the type of character that all speak of as
the Saint—a man who is ever alive to the realities of the
higher world; the man who lives in the Spirit, although
also living in the body.</p>

<p>Now I said that this idea was connected with the Mysteries
and with the Grail. Let me try and show you
how; and in this I am using the thought of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
French writer, Schuré, who, writing on the mystical idea
in the music of Wagner, pointed out the close resemblances
and differences between the sacrifice of the Mass
and the legend of the Grail. Now it is a historical fact,
apparently, that with the disappearance of the Mysteries
from Europe and the Christian Church, this legend began
slowly to work its way among the European nations.
There were the Mysteries of Jesus, and those played
in the Christian Church exactly the same part that is
played by the Yoga training, say, in Hindūism or Buddhism.
There was the life of the ordinary sacraments
for the ordinary believer. Those were the means
whereby the true believer came into touch with the
higher worlds. But when a man had learned all he could
in the outer circle of the Church, when he had used the
sacramental means of grace so that he was able to
say that his life was pure, that he had been “for a long
time conscious of no transgression,” then he was allowed
to present himself as candidate for the Mysteries of
Jesus. Within those Mysteries the realities replaced
the outer mechanism of the sacrament. There, no longer
by gift from without, as in the sacrament, but by effort
and struggle the vision of the spiritual life was attained.
And when those Mysteries passed away, not because
there were not teachers, but because there were no pupils
ready to be taught, then it was that this story of the
Grail was given as an announcement, however veiled,
that the ancient Path still remained open to the worthy
aspirant. For what is the inner meaning of the Grail,
and how do the main points of it connect with the
Christian sacrament? Different, yet similar. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
one it is the outer form of bread and wine, symbolising
the body and blood of Christ; in the other, the sacred
cup, in which it was said that once a year the blood of
Christ shone out with brilliant and purifying light. In
both an outer symbol. But in the sacrament that outer
symbol is given to the believer, and, without effort of his
own, the greater Self outside him gives to the weaker
Self within. But in the Grail it is by effort and struggle,
by temptation and resistance, that the vision becomes
possible. He has entered on the Path where outer aid
is withdrawn, and where the inner power must replace
the outer assistance. In the Church sacrament, faith is
the means whereby the truth must be attained. In the
inner, vision and knowledge take the place of faith, for
the successful knight sees the vision of the Grail—the
Cup, with all its glory, is revealed before him. And so in
the outer a dogma is taught, in the inner there is knowledge.
But what is a dogma? Knowledge imposed by
authority. In the Grail it is an inner revelation, a true
initiation into the Mysteries; and it is that inner revelation
which takes the place of dogma, a revelation which
comes by inner illumination instead of being taught by
the outer authority of a Church. And so you find
that in that vision the dove appears—symbol of inspiration.
The inspiration of the inner revelation is ever
there, and that inner revelation belongs to the body of
the Initiates, the elect out of all humanity. They hand
it on to the world outside, that which is knowledge to
them becoming dogma to the outer world. And so you
can see that in the Grail legend the teaching of the
Mysteries was symbolically conveyed, and those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
were able to pierce through the meaning of the legend
had their feet placed upon the Path where the symbols
became reality; the principle running through was identical.
And so the lesson was taught that for those who
cannot yet themselves build a bridge to the higher world,
the outer sacrament is given as the bridge to unite the
two; but when the man is able to make his own bridge,
the sacrament for him is no longer necessary. He
can reach the worlds above without the assistance of the
bridge, and then he becomes the Knight of the Grail.
That is still true. The Churches must ever give the
sacraments, because the masses of their believers are not
yet evolved enough to be able to build their own bridge.
For those who have reached the point in spiritual manhood
where the other worlds are known and are ever
present in consciousness, for them the value of the sacrament
is over, and the reality of the inner life no longer
needs the grace that is conveyed by the sacrament.</p>

<p>Now if you realise the facts I have been putting to
you, if you understand what the sacrament means and
what its value is, you will never speak lightly, contemptuously
of it, remembering that those who need it receive
in it a real power, and that those who have gone beyond
that necessity are those who are ever the tenderest to
the souls that still require it, and are careful that with
their wisdom they do not bewilder the ignorant, that
they do not lessen the means of grace for those who are
unable to reach knowledge for themselves. And inasmuch
as it is the duty of the members of the Theosophical
Society to know these facts of the different worlds,
and to use them for the helping of others, they have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
duty of trying to bring back the realisation of all the immense
value which may be found in these rites which are
little understood by the more skeptical communities to-day.
That your mission and your privilege. Whether
in your own religious communities you still find help or
not in these outer veils of spiritual things, that is a comparatively
small matter. As long as they help you, use
them to the utmost; and when you no longer need them,
then treat them with the reverence which is due to them,
and explain them to those who do not understand them.
Not very, very long will pass before all and much more
than I am saying to you will become common knowledge
in the Churches. Yours the privilege of knowing a little
sooner than the outside world; not because you are
specially favoured, but in order that you may carry
knowledge to the outside world. For every one of you
ought to lead the sacramental life, and that means that
you shall be a channel by which the spiritual forces shall
pour down and spread through you to those who surround
you, vivifying and spiritualising the world. That
your privilege, from the knowledge that has come to
you; that your duty, for knowledge brings responsibility.
And just in proportion as you understand the occult
truths out of which the esoteric religions have sprung,
so will you try to make those religions deeper, more
vital, more spiritualising to all that belong to them, so
that you may truly act as servants of religion, for such
servants every lover of the Divine Wisdom should be.</p>

<h3 id="II_Lecture_V">Lecture V<br />
<span class="smaller">Address on White Lotus Day 1909</span></h3>

<p>All over the world to-day the sun in rising has seen in
country after country men and women gathering together
to bear in memory those who have passed onward
through the gate of death, but who, in passing through
the gate, have remained even more living than they
were when they carried the burden of the flesh; men
and women who have left their names behind them as
workers for the Ancient Wisdom in its modern dress,
and whose memories remain dear and precious because
of the work they did, because of the message they
spread.</p>

<p>We have listened this evening to verses from the
<cite>Bhagavad-Gītā</cite>, to lines from <cite>The Light of Asia</cite>. In
India, on the early morning of to-day, words were read
from that same sacred Scripture of the eastern land,
spoken there in its ancient tongue, the Sanskrit. In
town after town, village after village, the memory of
those same lives is kept in mind. There also <cite>The Light
of Asia</cite> has been read, and the sacred memory of the
Buddha has been recalled. And all over India, from the
Northern Himalayas down to the South, thousands of
the poor have been fed by the branches of our Society in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
memory of those who lived, of those who passed away,
some of whom have come back to earth again. And as
the sun came onwards along its western path, it lighted
up other countries also, which kept the same memory,
used the same books, spoke the same names, and so
across Italy, and Russia, and Germany, and then in
France, and now here, and a few hours hence across the
Atlantic, in America, the same memories will be recalled,
the same books will be read, the same thoughts will be
spoken and will spread from heart to heart. For all
round the globe this day is kept sacred in memory of
those who died, as men say, amongst us, but who live to
carry on the mighty work that here they took up for the
brief day of mortal life. And we think of our dead,
our truly living, not with sorrow, not with mourning,
but with glad hearts and thankful lips, for we know that
death is nothing but a passing from one world to another,
a dropping of one body for the more effective
wearing of a subtler, finer, more powerful one than that
which, outworn, is cast away. For we have learned, and
some of us know practically, that that is true which is
written in that same Eastern Scripture of which we
heard some verses to-day, that the Dweller in the body
throws aside the outworn body as a man throws aside
garments outworn; and as the man takes new garments
for his wearing, so does the Dweller in the body take
new bodies for his wearing, for new days of a never-ending,
an immortal life.</p>

<p>And we think of those who have gone onward to-day—not
only of our greatest, but of all who have worked
and striven for the same great cause. And perhaps it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
fitting that first in that great roll we should send message
of love to the one who has left us last, who laboured so
long and so faithfully in France—Dr. Pascal—the General
Secretary there, who only a few weeks since passed
to the rest so well deserved. A weary time had he
in the passing; years of weakness, of suffering, of ever-decreasing
strength. And many ask, when they see so
long an illness and so much of pain, when they see a
life that was bright and helpful and full of service set
to this world in so long a twilight of sadness and suffering,
sometimes they ask: “Why should one who
served so well have so long and so sad a passing to the
other side?” But people do not always understand that,
when a man has worked well and done good service, ere
he goes to his rest for a little time on the other side, it
is well for him to pay the debts incurred, which otherwise
would hamper the new life when it comes back to
earth; and that there can be no better karma—sad as
it may seem to the outward sight—than when these
ties of the past are fully paid before the day of passing
comes, so that the new birth is unshadowed by the
shadows of the past, and debt is paid which otherwise
would be demanded when the new life is born. So that
in a life like that, which has ended sadly, as men say,
with body failing and brain failing, looking at that with
seeing eyes we see the preparing for a better birth, a
greater service, and we know that it is well that the
debt was paid, and that the new life shall come unencumbered
with the sad heritage of the past. And so to
our friend to-night we send messages of love and gladness
that the debt is paid, thankfulness that he has passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
over, so that he may come back again to work under
conditions fairer, nobler, more full of promise than
those in which he worked so bravely and so nobly
through the life that now has closed.</p>

<p>And as we look back we see the faces of many friends,
all of whom we commemorate—some of our own
country, some of other lands, some near at hand, and
some far off, who have passed to the other side in order
that they may return. For you remember that it is
written: “Certain is death to the born, and certain is
birth to the dead.” And those who have passed onward
are some of them turning their faces earthward
once again, because the times demand fresh workers, and
much is to be done in the years that are dawning upon us.</p>

<p>And one man stands out strongly in the minds of all,
our President, the President-Founder, who passed away
only two brief years since, and who is residing in his
Master’s home, but not altogether resting as men call
rest, inasmuch as he is ever eagerly working for the
Movement he loved and loves, and longing for the day
when he shall be permitted to take again a body to do
once more the work to which for many lives he has been
devoted.</p>

<p>And there rises the greatest name of all, H. P. Blavatsky,
the name of her who threw down the body she
was wearing on this 8th of May, which, for her dear
sake, was chosen as the day of commemoration of all
our workers who have passed onward—her name dearest
and nearest to our hearts, the Messenger of the
Lodge, she who was chosen to bring back to a world in
darkness the light which she carried so bravely and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
unflinchingly through a life of suffering and toil. And
strange is her recompense, that she, round whom so
many quarrels arose, she who was a sign of storm and
dispute through the warrior life that she led, she who
saw the Society well-nigh crumble round her in those
days of the Coulomb plot, when all over the world it
seemed that Theosophy was doomed to popular contempt,
and deserted by most who at one time had welcomed it;
she who, wherever she went, met storm and trouble, who
perhaps was more loved and more hated than anyone of
our own time, she has now the recompense that hers is
the one name which is everywhere beloved through the
great Society of which she and her colleague were the
founders, and also among those who have gone out of
it through the past years, those who left it in the Judge
secession, those who have gone out since; hers is the one
name that unifies, to whom all look back as teacher and
as friend. And a great and a beautiful lesson grows out
of that, that although life separates, death unifies; and
those who in life went away, as it seemed, from the
movement that she made, look back to her as founder,
and round her name, among the prominent people inside
and outside the Society, there runs to-day absolute unanimity,
and a peace without one ripple of dissent.</p>

<p>And to me that seems a very beautiful thing, that the
name that was the name of strife and of combat has
become the one name which is recognised as the foundation
of the Movement everywhere, no matter by what
passing changes that Movement may have been affected.
And it carries with it a valuable lesson. These changes
that we think so much of do not matter; all the storms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and troubles are of no account; on this great advancing
tide of truth and light, it matters not what apparent
storms may come, what rocks may be in the way, what
angry waves may rise and break, what feelings may be
expressed—the whole of it vanishes in the face of the
great unifier, Death; and those who were rent asunder
because they thought more of personalities than of
principles, they catch sight again of the principle when
death has smoothed away the difficulties of the persons
over whom they quarrelled. And so, looking back to
her to-day, we can see in her life and death a presage of
the future. None of the storms matter, and none of the
secessions and divisions count in the great work. They
are all mere trivial incidents of passing days, and the one
great Life rolls on, only the richer for the divergence,
only the fuller for the differences which it catches up
and blends into one.</p>

<p>And on this day, looking backward to those who have
gone through death’s portal, shall we not also look forward
to those who are coming back through birth’s
portal to work in the Movement in the future as they
worked in the Movement in the past? How far has it
struck you, during the days of storm and stress through
which you have been passing, that to those who believe
in Reincarnation and Karma there is no possibility of
real separation, no possibility of lasting discord? For
those who went far away apparently from the Movement,
or who left it by the gateway of death, see on the
other side the fundamental unity, even though on this
side, for a while, they may have been blinded by the superficial
differences, and join together in the work from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
which, on this side perhaps, for the moment, they had
let themselves slip away for some trivial discord, some
passing divergence of opinion. Take that great man
amongst us round whom raged the last great struggle,
the one before the struggle which is now nearing its
close—W. Q. Judge—one of the greatest and noblest
workers in our Movement, even though in the last days
of his life he made the great rent in the Theosophical
Society which cost us for the time pretty well the whole
Society in America. He again, winning clearer vision on
the other side after something of difficulty and something
of struggle (for the man was strong, and was not
easy to move or change even when the physical body
had been cast away), he after a while worked his way
through the mistake that had been made, and has again
thrown his life force, his enormous energy into the
Movement of which the outer partial manifestation here
is the Theosophical Society, and into that Theosophical
Society also. For remember that the Theosophical Society
is only the partial manifestation of that great stream
of Life which is flowing in the other worlds, and of
which some appears here. This great Theosophical
stream is like one of those rivers which flows underground,
and then bubbles up above the ground so that all
can see. And the river of the Ancient Wisdom, with its
source in the Great Lodge of the Masters, is out of
sight for the greater part of its course, in worlds greater
and higher than this, and then comes up above the
earthly surface and shows itself partially in what we call
the Theosophical Society; and into that River of Ages
lives which have passed onward throw their energy from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the other worlds, so that they are working in the same
Movement and strengthening the same current, and are
not apart from us, but with us all the time.</p>

<p>And then there are some others to whose return
amongst us we have the right to look forward. One
whom I may remind you of, who has not passed through
death’s gateway, although out of sight for so long, is that
faithful chelā of H. P. Blavatsky—Damodar—who left
India after the great Coulomb struggle, went up into the
Himālayan region, and found his way to his Master’s
home near far-off Shigatze. He has been living and
working there ever since, and is now a man of middle
age, but his return ere very long we may without fear
look forward to. He will come back to us with all the
gained knowledge that he has won during these many
years’ training in the presence of the Teachers Themselves;
he has already shown himself in India, not physically,
but preparing to come back when the Movement
is ready for his work, and the getting ready of it is the
work which we have to do in the few years in front. For
ere many years have gone we may look for his coming
as a leader and teacher amongst us.</p>

<p>And of those who passed through death’s gateway
some have already come back, H. P. Blavatsky amongst
them; so that in the years that come many of you will
see that strong life again manifested amongst us to take
share in the working of the Society, for which he is
working now as ever before. Remember how a Master
said of him: “The brother whom you know as H. P.
Blavatsky, but we—otherwise.” One who was spoken
of in such words by the Master M. does not leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
work to which he has put his hand because the worn-out
body was thrown aside for the time—the brother whom
we know as H. P. Blavatsky, but They otherwise, the
great and strong disciple will again come amongst us to
work more powerfully than in the woman’s body that
last time he wore. And others, too, who worked with
him in the earlier days—Subba Rao, whose name many
yet know; he is now a lad of nearly fifteen, in the Indian
body once more, born in fact in the same family (using
the word “family” in the wider Indian sense), a lad of
fifteen, very soon to be ready again to take up his work.</p>

<p>And there are others, less well known, who have been
reborn, and who are preparing to take part in the great
forward movement which is so soon to begin. But
before that work could begin it was necessary to have
the shaking through which we have been passing during
the last three years. I have told you often that from
time to time these shakings recur, and are necessary before
a great time of onward progress. Few of you
probably will remember the progress that was made
after the Coulomb trouble, but many of you will remember
the spring forward which the Society took after
the American secession. History repeats itself in small
cycles as well as in large ones, and before the great
forward movement could take place it was necessary
that the shaking should occur once more, to shake out
for the moment those who were not ready to go forward.</p>

<p>What is the great difficulty before the world? When
those who know more and are able to teach are to come
forward and live among the men and women of the time,
and bring to them the treasures they have harvested of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the Wisdom of the ancient days, the one thing that
stands in the way of their reception is the spirit which
is not able to recognise greatness when it sees it, but
meets it with suspicion, doubt, slander, calumny; which
ever supplies evil motives where there is no understanding
of the reasons for action, and so paralyses those who
know, and builds up barriers which even they cannot
overstep. You saw it in the life of H. P. Blavatsky. Look
back to that life of hers; see how her efforts, her endeavours
to teach and spread the Wisdom, the message
with which she was charged, were everywhere frustrated.
And that has been so now for very many centuries.
When the greatest of all Teachers came, that
mighty Teacher whom in the East we call the Bodhisattva,
whom in the West we call the Christ, when He
came—mightiest of spiritual Teachers, the very spirit of
Wisdom and love incarnate—He could not live three
years in this world ere He became so insupportable to the
people of His day that they slew Him, while His love for
the Father was denounced as blasphemy, His teaching denounced
as coming from the devil. And that same spirit
has been seen ever since. The great teachers have ever
been met with the same spirit, and we have to change it.
The chief mission of the Society at the moment is to prepare
the way of the Lord, and the only preparation that
can be made is to substitute reverence for greatness instead
of suspicion and hatred. And because that is the
immediate work which lies before us, it was necessary to
shake out of the Society those whose spirit was rather
suspicion of greatness than acceptance of it when seen.
For the immediate work is the preparing of the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
for the coming of greater Ones, in order that the new impulse
may be given when the new sub-race and Root
Race are to be born.</p>

<p>That is the immediate work, the preparation for the
coming of some of those whom I have been mentioning—Damodar,
Subba Rao, H. P. Blavatsky—not, remember,
with flourish of trumpets, or with anyone declaring
“this is so-and-so” and “this is someone else,” with the
exception, perhaps, of the first named (Damodar), who
went as a boy to his Master, and is now middle-aged,
but will be recognised by old Indian friends. But others
will be coming in new bodies, unknown, with no proof
of who they are. They will have to make their way,
they will have to prove their apostolate, and probably
their views of things will be very different from the
views of many of those in the Theosophical Society. Inevitably
so; for people whose eyes are opened to more
than one world cannot see things, as those see them
whose eyes are blind save to one; those who see the
wider horizon will have different thoughts from those
who are cabined in by the life and conventions of their
day. And that is why the great Ones are always misunderstood,
for They must be other than those to whom
They come, else how could They teach? And that is
where your General Secretary spoke very truly in saying
that the mind often misleads, and the things we “think”
cover over the things we “know.” Now the things you
know, you know by the light of the Spirit which is within
you; by that intuition which is the voice of the pure, not
the impure reason, speaking above the mind and through
the mind, but very often in contradiction to the mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
And in order to hear that voice of intuition, so far as I
know, there is only one way, that when once you see the
Light shine out through any human being, you hold to
that human being, no matter what the mind may say.
That is what spells success, and that was pre-eminently
the case with H. P. Blavatsky, for anyone more confusing
to the ordinary mind you could not possibly come
across—awkward, athwart one’s conventions in every
way; in speech, manner, actions, the very reverse of all
that you would expect. When I first met her and saw in
her the power of the Master, from that day to this I have
never challenged and never doubted her. And very, very
largely because of that have come the knowledge and
power that I have won not by reasoning and arguing—“Was
she right or wrong?” “Would it not have been
better if she had been different from what she was?”—but
having once seen in her the Light of Truth, refusing
to see anything else except the Messenger of the Master.</p>

<p>And that is what you need in the coming days, that is
what some of you have been winning through the storms
of the last three years—to realise that when once you
have known a teacher to be a teacher you shall cling to
that knowledge, no matter what clouds for a time surround,
no matter what storms for a time may hide; for
that means intuition, which is above the concrete mind;
it means the testimony of the God within you to the
God without you, and that cannot lie. And we have to
spread that through the whole Society in order to make
the way possible for those who will be coming amongst
us during the next few years, and the greater Ones who
will come later if we can welcome the Messengers, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
not otherwise. Our years of mortal life are not those by
which time is reckoned in the great cycles of the occult
world. It is true that we say: “Probably between thirty
and forty years hence a great Teacher will come back,
the greatest Teacher, the Teacher of Gods and men.”
But a date like that, which is counted by the revolutions
of the world, is always a doubtful thing from the occult
standpoint; for time there is measured by consciousness,
and not by the turning of the sun. Efforts may shorten
or failure may retard the date, and hence it is always
rather vaguely put; and if, when these less great ones
came we were not able to receive them, if we are repelled
by the superficial appearance and have not the intuition
to recognise the Messengers, that will inevitably delay the
coming of the greater Ones.</p>

<p>At different times different virtues are wanted. To
know the virtue of the time and to develop it, that is
wisdom. At one time courage is the great thing wanted;
at another time recognition of spiritual greatness, and
the power to hold to it, and that is the virtue wanted
now. Not in order that you and I as individuals may take
part in this great work, but in order that the world may
be prepared, that the way of the Lord may be made
straight, so that He may come. For He cannot come to
be a curse to the world instead of a blessing, as He would
be if the world were wholly unprepared. And so greater
and greater Ones will be coming in order that the greatest
of all may be welcomed when He appears amongst us.</p>

<p>Some of you think, but you think mistakenly, that
you would recognise, say, a Master, or even a Christ, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
He appeared. Are you so sure? They never have been
recognised by the people of their time save by a small
minority, and why should we be different? The Christ
was not recognised when He came last; His Messengers
have not been recognised since, save by a minority.
They are so different from the people of their time that
there is much to get over before you can recognise them.
And it is a good practice sometimes to throw yourself
back to those days in Judea when the Son of Man trod
the earth. Realise what He would have seemed to you
then, not what he seems to you now through the vista
of centuries of the adoration of millions of men. What
would he have seemed as the vagabond travelling about
on foot, with a number of half-educated people round
Him, disturbing the peace of society, antagonistic to the
respectabilities of His day, looked down upon by the
aristocracy of the time? See Him as they saw Him, and
ask yourself: “Should I have recognised the Christ?”
And that is where the test has been, right through these
last three years, and where it will be as the people I
have been speaking of gradually come amongst us again.
If you would recognise them when they come, try to
cultivate the power which answers to greatness without,
by cultivating greatness within, remembering that
spiritual recognition is the recognition of all those who
are kindred to yourself. If you have the virtue in you
of the spiritual man you will know spiritual men when
you meet them; but if you cannot answer to Him, then
He will pass you by unknown, and probably disliked.</p>

<p>Now our work is clear before us: to try to change the
public opinion of the world into the attitude which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
sometimes called disparagingly hero-worship, which is
essentially the thing we need at the present time—the
power to know the hero when we see him. “No man is
a hero,” it is said, “to his valet.” And people think that
that means that he is small when seen close by. Not so;
but that the small soul which is typified by the word
“valet” cannot appreciate the greatness of the hero near
whom he stands. The servant soul does not recognise
the greatness of the hero, and therefore the hero is no
hero to him. Only the heroic recognises the hero; and
if you can develop that in yourself which is like a
Master, then, and then alone, will you know a Master
when He comes. And the best way to cultivate it is for
a time to let go that spirit of criticism which makes people
so superior to those around them. Cultivate the faculty
of admiration rather than that of criticism. Try,
when you meet a person or when you read a book, to see
the good things in the book or person, and not the faults.
And the faults in the people around you, these are no
business of yours; and if you would once understand
that and live it, your path would be so much easier. So
many of you are so anxious to get other people out of
their faults that you really have no time to look after
your own steps and put them in the right way. The
faults of the other people will work out through karma,
and they are not your business—a hard but true lesson.
Of course, if you are a master or a teacher, and have
others in your charge, their faults are then yours to
correct; but you are not, generally speaking, masters or
guardians, and you have no responsibility to criticise or
put others right. Take out of your friends the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the good and let the faults go. You need not say they
are virtues, you need not pretend that you think wrong
right; but you can say: “That part of the man is not
my business; let me help the God in him to manifest,
and let the other side in him wear out in its own way.”
If you can do that you will be more useful now than
in any other spirit, and it is that lesson I would ask
you to take with you. Think of H. P. Blavatsky and of
those who have passed away in the spirit that they
helped us, and not in the spirit that would blind our eyes
to their value, and then carry that spirit on to the people
around you, and in every one round you try to see
the God, and let the rest go. Admire the admirable, and
leave aside the regrettable; for in doing it you will help
them more to conquer their faults than by criticism.</p>

<p>Seeing the God in them, and loving and trusting, that
will help them to grow out of the limitations, of the
blunders and errors that are hindering the divine manifestation.
And remember that is what is wanted now,
not for yourselves only but for every one around you, so
that when the Teachers come They may be able to remain
in the world amongst us. They dare not come yet,
because even in the Theosophical Society They would
not be welcomed. A Master who came amongst you now
would not for the most part be very much liked by you;
His ways, His views, His thoughts would be so different,
He would raise suspicion and dislike. We saw it in the
earlier days when They came out more, and were met by
judgment and criticism, until one of Them said, in the
fashion in which They look at ignorant criticism; “The
standard of the Adept is not kept at Simla, it is kept at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Shamballah and I try to accommodate myself to that.”
There is a great lesson in that for all of us. The standard
of those who are passing onward into the higher life
is not the standard of the judgment of the people around
them, but the standard that the Masters hold up before
them, to which they are ever trying to conform. Think
of that in your attitude to the people around you; remember
that on you, and on people like you everywhere,
depends the success or the failure of the next great manifestation
of the divine life on the earth; that this Theosophical
Society, spread everywhere over the world, is literally
the John the Baptist to prepare the way for the
coming of the Christ; to fill that part is your work and
duty—and need I say, your privilege, your highest
honour?</p>

<p>To leave the Society now, in the days which are just
dawning, surely it is bad karma enough, and you should
only feel the tenderest thoughts of pity towards any who
go out from us in the days when to belong to the movement
is the greatest crown that can be given for any nobility
of past life that any one of us may have had. No
words of harshness or of condemnation, nothing that will
make it harder for them to return, but everywhere gentlest
and most tolerant speech—this is our duty to our immediate
brethren; and to the world what I have told you.</p>

<p>And so from this White Lotus Day look forward more
than backward, rather to the work that is coming than
to the difficulties that are now well-nigh over. Remember,
for your strengthening, that the only great
shaking has been here and in America, nowhere else.
You can count on your fingers practically in other countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
those who have been shaken out. You have had the
struggle and have come out well. It is practically over
now. There may be some slight effort made now to make
things difficult, but what does it matter, with such hopes
before us, with such strength behind us, with such knowledge
within us? Why should we allow ourselves to be
ruffled by anything that can take place in this outer
world of men? We have been through many such struggles
in past lives, shall have to go through many greater
ones in lives to come; why make too much of present-day
trouble? Those whose lives are in eternity need not be
troubled with even what seem to be great difficulties to
the men and women of the world. And so to you I would
say: Gather together on the Day of Memory, but turn it
now more into day of looking forward. Let the past go;
it has done its work, it is over. Turn your eyes to the
work that is opening before us, more splendid than any
work of the past. And remember it is not the Messengers
who may stand in front who are the strength of the
Society, but that the life comes from the Masters and the
strength from the Lodge. Knowing that, you need not
mind even if those of us who are well known in the
world make mistakes, are attacked, or evil spoken of.
Never yet a Messenger of the Lodge that went through
life without being evil spoken of, and you need not
grudge us the sign of our apostolate; for such has ever
been the sign of the Messengers through all ages.
Rather rejoice with us that the stress for the time is
over, and the days of going forward are upon us; do not
let the remnant of the trouble shake any one of you,
but know that the Masters are with us, and where they
are no failure can come.</p>

<h3 id="II_Lecture_VI">Lecture VI<br />
<span class="smaller">The Nature of the Christ</span></h3>

<p class="lecture">Delivered to the Christo-Theosophical Society, at the invitation of
Sir Richard and Lady Stapley, Tuesday, May 25, 1909.</p>

<p>It is with pleasure that I find myself amongst you, as I
have often found myself before. I think my membership
in the Theosophical Society is of about the same length
as the life of your Society. We both began our careers,
so to speak, about the same time, in the same year.</p>

<p>The subject that I have taken is in many ways a
difficult one, and one that may very naturally arouse
differences of feeling. It is, however, one which is being
discussed very much in the Christian Church at the
present time, and it is for that reason that it seemed to
me that it might be useful if we could exchange thoughts
on a subject of enormous importance. I also want to
make certain suggestions which I think may be welcomed
in regard to an idea to be found in the East, which
perhaps is not quite familiar over here; and which presages
a unity greater and profounder than could be
reached, I think, in any other way. Naturally, I am
putting only my own views, and they commit no one but
myself. These questions that touch alike the intellect
and the heart must always be treated reverently by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
who realise the Brotherhood of man, and they are also
ideas of the profoundest importance with regard to the
future of religion and of civilisation.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Hibbert Journal</cite> of January last the subject that
I have taken for our talk was to some extent discussed
from the standpoint of one who I suppose would be
called an extremely liberal Christian. The writer is the
Rev. R. Roberts, Congregational minister, of Bradford;
his name is still in the Congregational Year-book, but I
heard that he was not at present ministering in any
pulpit. I take his view as my starting-point this afternoon.
The title of his article is at first sight a little
startling from the ordinary Christian standpoint, “Jesus
or Christ?” and he distinctly puts forward the view, and
argues for it with a good deal of ability, that we have to
do at once with one supposed to be a historical person,
and then apparently with what he could only regard as
a Mystical Ideal.</p>

<p>So far as I can gather from what he says, he does not
regard the Christ as historical, though he does not very
clearly draw the line as to how he would separate,
historically, the Jesus of the Gospels from that Ideal
which he names “The Christ.” He says that he and
many other people find themselves beset by certain
difficulties: “Are the claims to be presently set forth
made on behalf of a spiritual ‘Ideal’ to which we may
provisionally apply the word ‘Christ,’ or are they predicated
of Jesus?” Then he goes on to say that insistence
on limitations of knowledge, restrictions of outlook,
evasions of issues, and disillusionments of experience,
true enough of a historic Jesus, may not be wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
relevant to a spiritual “Christ Ideal,” expanding and
enriching through the ages into “the Christ that is to
be.” Then he says it would be still less applicable to
one who is regarded as the “fulness of Godhead,” “Very
God of very God.” That, practically, is his thesis, and
he tries to show in this article that very many difficulties
might be avoided if Christians were willing to recognise
a Christ Ideal side by side with the historical Jesus. In
that way they might evade some of the difficulties which
are pressed against the conception of Jesus as the Christ
by large numbers of people who find their faith challenged
and themselves in difficulties by these objections
which are put to them both inside and outside the
Church. He quotes Dr. Fairbairn, writing on <cite>Christ in
Modern Theology</cite>. “If He knows as God while He
speaks as man, then His speech is not true to His knowledge,
and within Him a bewildering struggle must ever
proceed to speak as He seems and not as He is. If He
had such knowledge, how could He remain silent as He
faced human ignorance, and saw reason wearied with the
burden of all its unintelligible mysteries? If men could
believe that once there lived on this earth One who
had all the knowledge of God, yet declined to turn any
part of it into science for man, would they not feel their
faith in His goodness taxed beyond endurance?” That
view (which appears to be adopted by Mr. Roberts) does
not seem to me necessarily at all a sound one, and it is
by no means certain that a man speaking in a particular
age to people among whom great limitations of knowledge
existed, and with a particular object before Him—not
to enlarge the bounds of science, but to deepen spirituality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and lay a strong foundation of morals—that such
a Teacher, however highly illuminated, however much
speaking as the very Spirit of God, would say all that He
knew with regard to external facts and external phenomena,
with the certainty of making very difficult the reception
of His message on points enormously important—on
points, in fact, of vital and essential need for the
higher spiritual progress of man. Hence it does not
appear to me that Dr. Fairbairn’s issue is at all well
taken. Every great teacher—not for the moment considering
the special divinity of Christ or Jesus—who is
speaking to people less instructed than himself is under
a similar difficulty. If on matters of ordinary scientific
knowledge he is illuminated where they are not, the very
fact that he presses that upon them would bewilder and
confuse. You cannot enable the human intellect to
evolve at what might be called a supernatural rate. It is
capable of growth, and often of rapid growth, but if you
try to force it beyond the rapid natural growth, you will
only perplex, bewilder, and confuse; and if your aim is
not, broadly, to increase scientific knowledge, which man
will inevitably find out for himself after a time, but to
help him to the things which need spiritual illumination
in order that he may receive them, then such a difficulty
as is put here as to the inner bewilderment which would
be felt by the speaker to speak as he seems, and not as
he is, would not be bewilderment at all, but a quite
deliberate limitation of what he said, with a view to the
effectiveness of his work, and that which he desired to
give to the people of his time. That is true necessarily
of every great prophet, of every highly inspired man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and the greatness of the inspiration would chiefly be
shown, not in the amount of physical knowledge which
he might give, but rather in his avoidance of certain
difficulties which, when the race grew more learned,
might come in their way and complete their ideas. That
is to say, he would evade the scientific difficulty as far as
he possibly could, and would do it deliberately, knowing
that that was not his particular work, and that he could
not do his own work if he turned aside in this direction.
So that, as far as I am personally concerned, looking on
this from the standpoint of the Theosophist and Occultist,
these difficulties to me do not exist. I realise that
they must always be found where one who is superhuman—I
object to the word supernatural—comes in any age of
the world’s history in order to teach a new conception of
religion, and in order to adapt what he is giving to the
civilisation which he intends to influence.</p>

<p>It appears to me that it is a perfectly rational and
necessary thing that the growth of knowledge from the
ordinary standpoint should be left to work its way out
along the lines of intellectual development; anything
less than that will check intellectual growth inevitably,
for intellectual growth can only come about by the freest
of thought, the freest of discussion, the most absolute
liberty to challenge everything and to controvert anything
which appears to be illogical. The condition of intellectual
growth is that of complete freedom, and any
sort of limitation which is put upon it by the knowledge
of a great teacher will only check that intellectual evolution
which is essential for the future growth of man.
Many similar difficulties, of course, are made with regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to all inspired Scriptures, and for that reason it seems to
me that it is well that we distinguish definitely between
the spiritual work of the spiritual teacher and the scientific
investigation of the scientific student; that it should
be realised that these two departments of human activity
work under different laws to a very great extent, and that
that which is spiritually known cannot always be justified
to the intellect until that intellect becomes spiritually
enlightened—that is, that you have to deal in man with a
being who is fundamentally a spiritual being, in whom
the divine Spirit becomes incarnate, embodied, but in
whom that divine Spirit is going to unfold along three
great lines of unfoldment which we find in all human
consciousness, which we recognise as in the divine nature
itself. It has to unfold to an ordered Activity which
should be truly in harmony with the laws of nature,
which are the expression of the divine nature in this
manifested form. It has to unfold along the Intellectual
line, and that unfoldment must be left utterly unfettered.
It has also to evolve along that line which in its lowest
stages is emotion, in its higher stages is religion; and
that spiritual unfolding, the highest characteristic of
Spirit showing itself out as Will, has to be developed
from above more than from below, to come downward
by illumination more than to climb upward by reasoning.
Unless we can understand this complicated nature of
man in whom divinity is gradually unfolding and mastering
matter at every stage of its unfolding, mastering,
purifying it, ultimately spiritualising it; in all its earlier
stages limited by the matter that it has yet failed to
master, gradually making it plastic and ductile, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
in its higher stages having utterly subdued it to its own
purposes—unless we can understand that that is a rough
outline of human evolution, we shall constantly find ourselves
in difficulties between the intellectual growth and
the spiritual unfolding. Hence whenever a man comes
to earth in whom divinity is far more manifestly unfolded
than in his fellow-men, he can only shed down
upon them illumination from the spiritual region, stimulate
their aims, but not control their intellect. If that be
realised, then the whole of these difficulties, which are
being made at the present time about the obvious limitations
outwardly of the knowledge of the supreme Christian
Teacher, will entirely fall out of court, and you
will see that He was speaking to the people of His day
in the way that He could best affect them in order to
help forward their evolution from the standpoint where
they were, and was not the least intent on showing out
His enormous knowledge, which would only have
crushed rather than assisted.</p>

<p>Suppose for the moment you can take that way of
looking at human evolution—and it seems to me the most
rational way of looking at it—then we come to deal with
this special manifestation of the Teacher who was the
Founder of Christianity, a Hebrew speaking to Hebrews,
and having to reconcile the speaking to the people
of His day with the speaking to people of generations
after generations, through centuries and perhaps millennia
to come, then we should be perfectly able to
realise that we are here face to face with one of those
supreme divine manifestations, and that in studying
it we must be ready to separate between the Teacher of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
religion and the man speaking to the men of His day, and
accepting their limitations in order that He might reach
them effectively. I want to carry you very much further
than that in what I say; all that might very well be
accepted by any rational and intelligent Christian, especially
if he finds himself able to realise that what is said
of the divinity of Jesus is true at a very much lower
level of all His brethren, that all men are fundamentally
and essentially divine; that that which was said by the
great teacher S. Paul: “Know ye not that your body is
the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth
in you?” and that which was answered by Jesus Himself,
when he was challenged for calling Himself the Son of
God: “Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are
Gods, and ye are all the children of the Highest?” is
literally true. If you realise all that is implied in that
statement, that He is the first among many brethren, you
will see that every Son of Man is potentially, and will
hereafter be actually, a Son of God, meaning by that that
Deity will unfold within him, and that a manifestly divine
humanity is the natural goal of evolution.</p>

<p>One realises, in looking at an article like this, that by
the mystic Christ—that is what the writer means—he
means that in the Epistles a somewhat different view is
taken from that of the Gospels, the one dealing specially
with an historical person, the other with an indwelling
Spirit. He realises that when the Apostle Paul declares
to his converts that he is travailing in birth for them
until Christ be formed in them, when he says in another
passage that they are to develop to the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ, he is holding up before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
them a picture of the birth in the soul of this divine Spirit
that he spoke of as Christ, and the gradual unfolding
of that into the perfection of divine manhood. That is
perhaps the most inspiring ideal that can well be put
before Christian people, that not only outside them but
within them, not only as an outer helper but as an indwelling
Spirit, this idea of the Christ is to be realised,
and that that unfolding of the Christ in man is a real
fact in religious consciousness, making that highest stage
of human evolution when the man becomes perfect, and
there only remains before him the superhuman evolution
after the human is finished.</p>

<p>But I want to put to you rather a different idea of this
relation between Jesus and Christ. I recognise to the
full the value of that mystic ideal, I have not one word
to say against it; in fact it is one that, when I am speaking
to Christians, I constantly proclaim—the absolute
necessity of that indwelling presence. But there is
another view of this great Being which may be less
familiar to you, which is the view taken by those who
are sometimes called Occultists, in a very special sense
of the term. Let me put it to you quite baldly for the
moment, and then work it out a little more. The view
that we take of that great Teacher who came to the
world some two thousand years ago is, that the child
who was born and who grew up into manhood until the
time of the Baptism was a man of marvellous purity, of
extraordinary spiritual intuition, but a man that we
should call a disciple; that it was his to train and guard
that pure body in preparation for the incoming of the
indwelling Christ, and that in the Gospel story it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
event of the Baptism which marks the coming of the
Christ. Let me just recall the words to you for a moment:
“When Jesus went down into the water, the
heavens opened, and the Spirit of God came down upon
Him like a dove, and abode upon Him. And a voice was
heard from heaven saying, ‘This is my beloved Son;
hear ye Him.’” Now it is clear that that event, marked
out so distinctly in the Gospel story, must connote something
of enormous importance. There was no need, as
it were, for Him who was to be the Teacher to be baptised,
and to receive the downcoming Spirit of the Most
High, unless in that there was hid some profound spiritual
truth, unless something was there afterward that
was not there before; and it is <em>then</em>, from the occult point
of view, that the <em>Jesus</em> became the <em>Christ</em>. But let me
put it to you even a little more closely. Here, of course,
is where the point of difference will probably arise in the
minds of many in regard to what I am saying, for all
might be willing to recognise that that might imply a
great downflow of spiritual energy, of divine life. From
our standpoint Jesus the Hebrew, the individual, the
spiritual man, stepped out of the body that he had been
dwelling in through all those years and preparing for the
coming of his Lord, giving it over as a holy temple for
the incoming of the supreme Teacher, so that the body
became the habitation of the supreme Teacher for the
three years of the ministry. Now that view, as many of
you who have studied Christian history will know, was
very widely held in the early Church; although it was
condemned later as the Gnostic heresy, none the less it
was quite orthodox until its formal condemnation within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the Catholic Church, until the time that it was expelled.
You find it in many of the early writings of the learned
Christian teachers, you find it warred against by some
others of the Christian teachers and doctors and bishops
of the time, but none the less it was a view which had
very wide prevalence in the early Church; it was accepted
by large numbers of profoundly learned men;
and although ultimately condemned as a heresy in the
forms in which it was put, it might none the less not be
improbable, even from the standpoint of the orthodox,
that some truth was hidden in it in the broad sense, even
if the form in which it was put forward in the Church of
those days was justly condemned. My own view is that
they were right, not in all the details of the way in
which they put it, but in the fundamental fact. Let us
suppose for a moment that they were so; then the
question would necessarily arise—who is the Christ?
And it is there that, as I said, there was one view that
might be unfamiliar to you in the West, yet which, it
seems to me, should be to the Christian a view full of
beauty and full of hope for the future. There is only
one Supreme Teacher of mankind. There is a great
office above all those whom we Theosophists speak of as
Masters—a Master of Masters, so to speak—the one
Supreme Teacher. In Christendom you speak of him by
the Greek name, a name which, as you know, was taken
from the Grecian mysteries, of which a particular grade
of initiation bore the name of the Christos, and the Adept
who reached that grade was spoken of as the Christos.
That was the name which was adopted in the early
Church, according to the account in the Acts, to designate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
this great Teacher who had come to the world, and we
should say, rightly adopted. It is an instance of spiritual
insight recognising a great truth.</p>

<p>But now, supposing I ask you to go to the people of
other religions for a moment, the ancient religions that
we find in the eastern world. Suppose I ask a member
of the most ancient of those, the Hindū faith: “Do you
recognise in your religion one supreme World-Teacher
above all religions, and not belonging to one exclusively—a
universal Teacher?”—he would say, “of Gods and
men”; over here you would say, “of Angels and men,”
because the word there, Deva, is equivalent to your word
Angel. He would at once say: “Why, yes; of course
we recognise one Supreme Teacher at the head of all
spiritual life and impulse, and we call him (pardon me if
I use for the moment their name) the Jagat-Guru—the
World-Teacher.” Supposing I went to another great
religion there—the Buddhist—and I asked a member the
same question: “Do you recognise in your religion a
Supreme Teacher?” his answer would at once be, “Why,
of course we do. There is only one who holds the place
of Teacher over all Gods and all men; one Teacher
only who is the Teacher of the world. We call Him
the Bodhisattva—the Wisdom-Truth.” No nobler name
could be given to Him; He is the Wisdom and the
Truth; not the Buddha, as you may have expected me
to say; He was not the Teacher. When He reached
Buddhahood He passed away from earth. It is while
He is going onwards to Buddhahood that He is known
by this name of Wisdom-Truth, or Boddhisattva. During
the whole of that period of teaching He has this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
name; and then when the supreme illumination comes to
Him his office is finished, and He passes away from
earth. Of course, as we know, the last Buddha remained
in his body for some time, still teaching, but none the
less the office of the Teacher is not to the Buddhist the
Buddha, but he who is to be the Buddha—what you
would call the Christ glorified and ascended, not the
Christ on earth teaching and suffering. It is interesting
to notice how in the various religions these same points
arise and these same differences are seen under different
names, so that we see that in these two greatest of eastern
religions a Supreme Teacher is recognised. Now,
from the occult standpoint, it is that Teacher who came
as the Christ; and, supposing that all Christian people
recognised that fact, they would reach the hearts of the
eastern world far better than they do now, if, instead of
telling them they must worship the Christ, they would
say to them, “You are already worshipping Him under
a different name,” which is supremely true; for it is the
same Being who holds that office through all these
thousands of years, the same supreme Perfection. He
only comes into manifestation in order to help His
younger brethren; He leaves that body when its utility
for the moment is over; when, being so great in comparison
with the people to whom He came, they could
no longer tolerate His presence.</p>

<p>Now that is the view of the nature of the Christ which
you would find among, say, Occultists or well-instructed
Theosophists. They recognise in the Christ of Christendom
the Supreme Teacher of the world, but they do not
admit that He will come only once to the world; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
reverence and honour Him now as still the Supreme
World-Teacher, but they do not identify Him with the
great disciple who took the Jewish name as Jesus, and
who is now amongst us as the Master who is the Guide
and Helper of the Christian Church. There is the point
where the difference would come in. The orthodox
Christian would claim Him as supreme over all religions,
but he would hardly recognise difference between the
disciple who has become the Master with the special
Christian Church in His charge, and the Supreme
Teacher who, while He certainly ever sends His benediction
upon Christianity, sends it also upon the other
great religions of the world. This is where I feel the
difference might come in between myself and many of
you. To us the great Master Jesus, who is, as you would
also acknowledge—those of you, at least, who are members
of the Church of England—thus still dwelling in
a human body, still embodied literally, has that power
which the Master on the higher planes of being has, of
being spiritually in touch with all who call upon Him,
with all who look to Him for guidance, but none the less
still possesses a physical body. This is a point of enormous
importance (although not as important as spiritual
omnipresence), for it means to us, and it means to
many Christians who think with us, and are Theosophists
with us, a possibility of a close and personal relation, as
of a disciple to a Master, which goes somewhat beyond
the spiritual communion which every true Christian has
with his great Teacher. How should I put that to convey
exactly what I mean in clear and definite language?
I must put it, I think, by giving a general principle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
regard to these great Beings whom we speak of as Masters,
divine men, men made perfect, which works
through the whole of that great Brotherhood. They
have many ways of working in the world; through their
own subtle, spiritual bodies they work, sending out
floods of blessing over the whole world; but, in addition
to that spiritual impulse and spiritual blessing
which flow into every heart that opens itself to receive
them, with an ever present and potent power, there is an
even closer and more specialised communion between
the Spirit as embodied and those who are still wearing
human bodies themselves, a possibility which the saints
have realised of that personal and individual and specialised
communion with their Master where they saw
Him, heard Him; where to them He became, not only a
spiritual presence, but an individualised Teacher, and
even Friend; where they knew themselves as disciples,
and knew Him as Master, which is the great mark, after
all, of those who are specifically called the saints. For
that close and intimate and specialised relationship the
body is necessary; and hence, although sceptics have
very often challenged that Article of the Church of
England where it says that “He did truly take again His
body, with flesh and bones, and all things appertaining
to the perfection of man’s nature,” it does convey a fundamental
and essential truth: the great Teacher is not
only a spiritual Presence, He is a human though divine
Being, who can be specifically and personally known.
And if this latest impulse of Divine Wisdom which we
call Theosophy is to be of use to Christendom, it will be
along these lines of gradually winning Christians back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
to a conception that has been very largely lost—that
their touch with their Divine Master must be much closer
and more realised in the brain and human heart as contact
of disciple and Teacher, than when they are thinking
of Him as Deity, when they are regarding Him as
the second Person in the Trinity. How far that will
commend itself to many of you it is, of course, impossible
for me to say; but let the outline, at least, be
clear, so that it may be definitely understood. It is the
conception of a Christ for whom a body was prepared,
and prepared by His own well-loved disciple, who
guarded, tended, trained it through the years of childhood,
of youth, and of early manhood; a body surrendered
to the incoming mighty Personage, who is the
Supreme Teacher of the world, incoming at the point
marked by the Baptism, worn until the time of the
death, so that through the whole of that teaching, the
ministerial life, it was not Jesus but the Christ who was
the Teacher who founded Christianity. That body is
laid aside, but He is still Lord of all religions, and He
gives to His well-beloved disciple who became the Master
Jesus this religion specifically as his charge, his work
in the world. Other religions would have other Masters,
but only one Supreme; others would look to other divine
men made perfect, but would recognise beyond them
this Master of Masters; and hence all religions draw
together in the Supreme Teacher, and find there unity
in that greatest and mightiest of all. So that every religion
looks up to the one Teacher through Masters
who specifically belong to the various faiths of the
world. That is the view which is very generally held in
the Theosophical Society, although none is bound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
accept it, inasmuch as we impose no dogmas upon anyone;
it is the view which is taken by those who have
been most thoroughly instructed in this matter; and it
seems to me that it is one of extreme interest to thoughtful
people, even if they do not find themselves able to
accept it.</p>

<p>That is, then, the view of the nature of Christ that I
would submit to you; and if you look at it you will see
that the whole of the criticisms to which I have referred
fall to pieces, and no longer need disturb the hearts or
consciences of any; for it would be recognised that you
have here a manifestation of the same great Being, but
not a unique manifestation, who adapts Himself to the
needs of His time, gives out so much of His wisdom and
truth as He thinks can be accepted by the people of His
day and generation, but who, in giving it, gives with it
an inspiring Spirit, which enables future generations to
find more and more in that teaching, and as they themselves
develop spiritually, to find ever greater depths in
the teaching which had been given by the Christ. You
will see how naturally that view passes on into the
future, and why it is that many of us, believing that a
new civilisation is dawning upon earth, also believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the same Supreme Teacher will again be manifested,
again to tread the earth as He trod it in Judæa, again to
enlighten the world with spiritual wisdom, again to
strike the keynote of a new civilisation, gathering all
the religions of the world under that supreme teaching
of His own, so that we look forward to a coming Christ
as well as backward to a Christ in His last manifestation
on the earth.</p>

<span class="smaller">The Theosophical Student
in face of
Revelation, Inspiration, and Observation</span></h3>

<p class="lecture"><i>A Lecture delivered to the British Convention of
the Theosophical Society, July 4th, 1909</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>Friends: Those who seriously take up the study of
Theosophy should not be satisfied with the mere reading
of the voluminous theosophical literature poured out
into the world through the centuries of the past, and continuing
to flow into it in our own days. They should, in
addition, if they have any innate faculty for such investigation,
prepare to develop the faculties by which
they may verify for themselves that which they are
told by others. But in all cases much theoretical study is
desirable before passing on into the practical, and in
most cases it may not be possible to develop the subtler
senses within the limits of the present incarnation, although
a good foundation may be laid for such development
in the next. Hence theoretical study must
form a large part of the training of every theosophical
student, and his attitude towards such study is a matter
of serious importance. He needs to discriminate between
the books he reads, and to suit his attitude to
the type of the book; he must seek to understand what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
is meant by Revelation, what by Inspiration, and to
distinguish revealed from inspired literature, and both
from the records of observations.</p>

<p>Some Scriptures which are regarded as authoritative
lie at the back of all the great religions. Thus Hindūism
has the Veda. The word means knowledge, and this
knowledge is of that which is eternally true. It is the
knowledge of the Logos, the knowledge of the Lord of
a universe; the knowledge of what <em>is</em>, not of what <em>seems</em>;
the knowledge of realities, not of phenomena. This
abides ever in the Logos; it is part of Himself. In its
manifested form, as revealed for the helping of man, it
becomes the <cite>Vedās</cite>, and in this form goes through many
stages, until finally little of the original remains. All
Hindū schools of philosophy acknowledge the supreme
authority of the Vedas; but after this formal acknowledgment
is made, the intellect is allowed to range freely
at its will—to inquire, to judge, to speculate. Rigid as
Hindūism is in its social polity, it has ever left the
human intellect free; in philosophy, in metaphysic, it has
ever realised that truth should be sought, and no penalty
inflicted on error; error being sufficiently penalised by
the fact that it <em>is</em> error, and breeds misfortunes under
natural laws. Even to-day that ancient liberty is maintained,
and a man may think and write as he will provided
that he follows in practise the social customs of
his caste. The Hindū divides all knowledge into two
types—the supreme and the lower. In the lower he
places all his sacred books—following in this the dictum
of an Upanishad<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>—together with all other literature, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
science, all instruction; in the category of the supreme
he places only “the knowledge of Him by whom all
else is known.” There you have Hindūism in a nutshell.
When once supreme knowledge has been attained and
illumination has been experienced, all Scriptures become
useless. This is asserted plainly and boldly in a
well-known passage in the <cite>Bhagavad Gītā</cite>: “All the
Vedas are as useful to an enlightened Brāhmana as is a
tank in a place covered over with water.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> What need
of a tank when water is everywhere? What need of
Scriptures when the man is enlightened? Revelation is
useless to the man to whom the Self is revealed.</p>

<p>In the early days of Buddhism the Vedas held high
place, for the Lord Buddha, as Dr. Rhys Davids says,
“was born and brought up, and lived and died a Hindū.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
But the charter of intellectual freedom for Buddhists is
contained in the wise advice of their Teacher: “Do not
believe in a thing said merely because it is said; nor
in traditions because they have been handed down from
antiquity; nor in rumours, as such; nor in writings by
sages, merely because sages wrote them … nor
on the mere authority of your own teachers or masters.
But we are to believe when the writing, doctrine, or
saying is corroborated by our own reason and consciousness.
For this I have taught you: not to believe merely
because you have heard; but when you believed of your
own consciousness, then to act accordingly and abundantly.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Even revelation, for the Buddhist, must
be brought to the touchstone of reason and consciousness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
there must be a response to it from within, the
interior witness of the Self, ere it can be accepted as
authoritative.</p>

<p>In the Christian and Muhammadan faiths—both
largely influenced by Judaism—the authoritative nature
of revelation is carried further than in any earlier faith.
In modern days the yoke of a revealed Scripture has
been much lightened for Christianity by the growth of
the critical spirit and by the researches of scholars. The
modern Christian student is little more hampered by
his revelation than is the Hindū by his. A conventional
reverence is yielded, a lifting of the hat, and then the
student goes freely on his way.</p>

<p>What is Revelation? It is a communication from a
Being superior to humanity of facts known to Himself,
but unknown to those to whom He makes the revelation—facts
which they cannot reach by the exercise of the
powers that they have so far evolved. These facts can
be verified at any time by one who has climbed to the
level of the Revealer, who may be an Avatāra, a Rishi, a
Founder of a religion. They “speak with authority,”
the authority of knowledge, the one authority to which
all sane men bow. We do not find that these great
Beings wrote down Their teachings Themselves; They
taught, but They did not record. Some follower, some
disciple, it may be after the lapse of many years, even
of centuries, wrote down what he or his forefathers had
heard; hence the revelation—and to this rule there is
probably no exception—is inevitably to some extent coloured,
narrowed, distorted by the transcriber. That
which was heard originally by those round the divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Teacher exists indeed in the ākāshic records, and may
ever be recovered thence by those who have developed
the inner senses by which those records may be read.
In many cases true records will have been made at the
time by highly qualified persons; but such precious books
are kept securely in the custody of their chosen guardians,
in secret temples, in rock libraries, available for
the study of high Occultists, but of none other.</p>

<p>The Muhammadans would claim that in the case of
their sacred book there is more certainty that the very
words of their Prophet were preserved. And doubtless
to this is due the overwhelming authority of <cite>Al
Qurān</cite> in the minds of the faithful of Islām.</p>

<p>What should be the attitude of the Theosophical
Student towards revelation? He should treat the
Scriptures of the world with reverence, remembering
their origin, but none of them with submission, remembering
that they are transmitted to him by varied channels.
He should call to his aid the best scholarship,
should gain all the light he can from archæological and
historical researches, and use his best critical judgment
in separating the essential truth revealed from all the
accretions that may have grown up around it. If he
has developed his higher psychic qualities, he should
try to trace and disentangle the ancient from the modern,
search the ākāshic records for comparison, confirmation,
or contradiction of the revelation as it has
come into his hands. How immense might be the services
of such Theosophical Students as they become more
numerous and better equipped for this gigantic task.
And without this external equipment much may be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
by inner unfoldment; he may unfold within himself
his own spiritual powers; he may seek in profound
meditation the truth which shines in the revelation
beneath many a veil of ignorance and misconstruction;
he may so purify his life that his bodies will become
translucent of the light of the spirit within him, will
illumine the written words. “The things of God
knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.” But that Spirit
dwells in every child of man; and as His light shines
out, the divine things are revealed to the pure in heart.
Until the inner Spirit thus responds to the revealed
teachings and statements, the Theosophical Student must
hold his judgment in suspense before the claims of
any revelation. It is not true <em>for him</em> until he can re-echo
it in the voice of his own Spirit, his deepest Self.
Useful and beautiful it may be; worthy of profoundest
study and reverent research are the world’s Bibles. But
until they are affirmed by the Spirit within submission
cannot be yielded, lest that should be given to the errors
of men which is due only to the divine Spirit.</p>

<p>What is Inspiration? The raising of the normal human
faculties by some extraneous influence through
grade after grade of intellectual, moral, and spiritual
power, up to the point where the extraneous influence
may even expel the man from his body and use it for
the expression of another individual; where the new
possessor is a Being at a height utterly transcending
man, inspiration may pass into revelation. Some may
think the word should be restricted to the raising of the
powers of the subject from above their normal capacity
to the highest point of their possible exercise, short of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the expulsion of their owner and his replacement by
another individual greater than himself.</p>

<p>The lower grades of inspiration are within the experience
of very many. Have you never felt, when listening
to a speaker whose knowledge and power transcended
your own, that your mental faculties were lifted to a
higher level than that to which you could rise unaided?
On such occasions you grasp questions that hitherto
have eluded you; you see plainly, where before there
had been obscurity; the field of thought becomes illumined,
and objects are seen in hitherto undreamed-of
relations—you feel that you know. On the following
day you desire to share with a friend the treasures you
acquired, and you begin to recount the luminous exposition,
to describe the great horizons which opened before
you. You fail: where is the light, where the far-off
scenes over which your eyes had swept? Your mind has
sunk again to its normal level; the inspiration has passed
away. As with the intellectual, so with the moral faculties.
You had seen an unknown beauty, had felt an
overwhelming admiration for the lofty and the pure:
what has become of the warmth, the ardour? Are the
cold ashes of the intellectual approval all that remains
of the throbbing heart, the passionate delight in the
moral ideal? Why does it now look so cold, so grey, so
unattractive? You were raised to a higher level than
you can reach unassisted; but none the less has the
moral ideal and its power been shown to thee “in the
Mount,” and the fact that you have once experienced its
all-compelling power will render you more susceptible
to it in the future, and the day will come when that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
which you felt when inspired by another shall become
the normal exercise of your own moral faculties.</p>

<p>Coming to higher grades of inspiration, we may
know, some of us, what it is to stand in the presence
of the Masters, and to feel the marvellous uplift of
Their presence. There is no need for words, no need
for teaching; Their presence is enough. From that
presence we go out again into the ordinary world, to
feel the difference of its atmosphere from that of the
Holy One. But, <em>we have known</em>, and the memory remains
an abiding power.</p>

<p>Those who have written or spoken under inspiration
have been thus uplifted, their own intellectual and moral
faculties have thus been stimulated, and raised far
above their normal level. It is still they who write or
speak, and their own characters and temperaments colour
what they say, leave their own impress on what
they write. But they write and speak far more nobly,
far more powerfully than they could do unassisted.</p>

<p>And so we may rise from grade to grade of inspiration
until we reach the stage at which the mind and emotions
of the man no longer sway his body, but the body
is wholly taken possession of and used by One greater
than himself. Then it is no longer the man himself who
speaks, but “the Spirit of” his “Father who speaketh
in” him; his own limitations are struck away, his own
idiosyncrasies vanish, and the inspired utterances flow
forth unsullied. Then inspiration may range into
revelation.</p>

<p>The process of all this is a very simple one. We
know that by the correlation between changes in consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and vibrations of matter, each change in
consciousness is accompanied by a vibration of the matter
appropriated by the consciousness and forming its
body; each vibration of the matter of a body is accompanied
by a change in the embodied consciousness.
Either one of the pair may be the initiator; the other ever
responds. When two or more people are together, one
more evolved than the other or others, the more evolved
person, thinking, desiring, acting, sets up in his own
bodies, mental, astral, and physical, a series of vibrations
which corresponds to the changes in his consciousness;
these vibrations cause similar vibrations in the
mental, astral, and physical matter intervening between
himself and the less advanced person or persons present.
These vibrations in the intervening matter cause
similar vibrations in the neighbouring body or bodies.
These vibrations are immediately answered by corresponding
changes in the embodied consciousness or consciousnesses,
and the person or persons concerned, thus
placed <i lang="fr">en rapport</i> with one more advanced, think, desire,
act on a higher level than would be possible for
them on their own initiative. They are able to understand
more keenly, to feel more warmly, to act more
nobly than they could do unassisted. When the stimulus
is removed they gradually sink back to their normal
level, but memory is left, and they remember that they
“have known.” Moreover, it is more easy for them to
respond a second time, and so on and on, until they
establish themselves on the higher level permanently.
Hence the value of companionship with those more advanced
than ourselves, of living “in their atmosphere.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Words are not necessary; little speech may pass; but insensibly
the subtle body is tuned to a higher key, and
only, perhaps, when the companionship is interrupted
do the younger become conscious of the change which
has thus been brought about by contact with the elder.</p>

<p>Similar results may be brought about by reading the
writings of those who are more evolved than we are.
A similar series of changes is set up, though less powerfully
than by the living presence. Moreover, intent and
reverent study may attract the attention of the writer
whether he be in or out of the body, and may draw him
to the student, and thus cause the latter to be enveloped
in his atmosphere quite as potently as though he were
physically present. Hence the value of reading noble
literature: we are keyed up to its level for the time, and
such reading, steadily persevered in, will lift us to a
higher level and establish us thereon. Hence the value
of a brief reading before meditation, lifting us into an
air more favourable to the work of meditation than we
can start from unassisted. Hence the value also of “holy
places” for such meditation, places where the atmosphere
is literally vibrating at a higher rate than our own; and
hence the advice so often given by the instructed, to
keep, if possible, a room or closet set apart for meditation,
such a place soon gaining an atmosphere purer
and subtler than that of the surrounding world. It is of
little use for the theosophical student to be acquainted
with these laws if he does not utilise them to his own
helping, and to the helping of those around him.</p>

<p>What should be the attitude of the theosophical student
towards the inspired man or the inspired book?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
He should be receptive, stilling all his normal vibrations
so far as is possible, and opening his whole nature to
the impact and influx of the waves of vibration that
pour forth upon him. But his attitude should be more
than receptive: he should gently endeavour to attune
himself and to co-operate with the inflowing waves. He
should try to strengthen the sympathetic vibrations, so
that the accompanying changes in consciousness may
be as complete as possible. For this he must pour out
to the inspiring Object his love, his trust, his complete
confidence and self-surrender, for thus only can he attune
his bodies into sympathy with those of the Inspirer.
He must, for the time, empty himself of his own ideas,
his own feelings, his own activities, surrendering himself
to reproduce, not to initiate. As the unruffled lake
can mirror the moon and the stars, but as that same lake
rippled by a passing breeze can yield only broken reflexions,
so may the lower being, steadying his mind,
calming his desires, and imposing stillness on his activities,
reproduce within himself the image of the higher,
so may the disciples mirror the Master’s mind. And
so, also, if his own thoughts spring up, his own desires
arise, will he have but broken reflexions, dancing lights,
that tell him nought.</p>

<p>If you are going to read one of the inspired books of
the world—<cite>The Imitation of Christ</cite>; <cite>The Golden Verses</cite>
of Pythagoras; <cite>The Light on the Paths</cite>; <cite>The Voice of
the Silence</cite>—it is well to preface the reading with a
prayer, if that be your habitual way of raising your
consciousness to its highest mood, or with the repetition
of a mantra, or the soft chanting of some familiar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
beloved rhythm, in order to bring yourself into a sympathetic
condition. Then read a phrase, re-read, brood
over it, savour it mentally, suck out its essence, its
life.</p>

<p>Thus shall your subtle body become, to some extent
at least, attuned to that of the inspired writer, and
repeating his vibrations, shall set up in your consciousness
the corresponding changes. Priceless is the value
of inspired books: they are steps of a ladder set up between
earth and heaven, a veritable Jacob’s ladder, on
which descend and ascend the angels of God.</p>

<p>There remains a third class of books worthy of the
attention of the theosophical student, but towards which
his attitude should be entirely different from those which
he adopts towards the revealed and the inspired. These
are books containing the observations of students more
advanced than himself, observations carried on upon
planes above the physical, observations made by students
who are evolving in knowledge of, and in power
on, those planes, and have not yet reached the stature
of the Perfect Man. There are books such as <cite>The
Secret Doctrine and Esoteric Buddhism</cite>, written by
disciples, which are not records of the direct observations
of students, but are rather transcriptions of the
teachings of Masters, into which errors may creep by
misunderstandings of those teachings. H. P. Blavatsky
herself told us that there were inevitably errors in <cite>The
Secret Doctrine</cite>; and as we have in that wonderful book
her own descriptions of the pictures shown to her by
her Master, there is an opening for possible errors of
observation: these are probably not serious, as she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
carefully overlooked and aided during the writing.
These two books stand apart from the bulk of our literature,
the Masters having been largely concerned in
their production. The books I have in mind are those
written by disciples, using their own normal faculties,
faculties still in course of evolution; books relating
chiefly to the astral, mental, and buddhic planes, to the
constitution of man, to the past of individuals, nations,
races, and worlds. We are gradually accumulating a
large amount of literature of this kind, a literature of
observations by students using superphysical faculties.
With regard to this, certain things need to be borne in
mind.</p>

<p>First: the students in question are in course of evolution,
and the faculties of which they make use to-day,
which have become their normal faculties, are more developed
and reach higher planes than those which they
used ten or fifteen years ago. Hence they see now very
much more than they saw then, both in quantity and
quality, and this enlarged sight must inevitably give reports
differing in fulness from that of the earlier and
narrower vision.</p>

<p>Secondly: this greater fulness will change relative
proportions and perspective. A thing which seemed
imposing and independent when seen alone, may become
subordinate and comparatively insignificant when seen
as a part of a larger whole. It may change form and
colour, seen with surroundings which become visible
only when it is looked at with a higher vision. That
which was a globe, sailing through space, to the physical
eye, becomes the free end of a continuous body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
materially attached to the sun, when seen with superphysical
sight. Was it false to describe it a globe? Yes,
and no.</p>

<p>It was and is a globe on the physical plane, answering
to all that is meant by a globe down here. In subtler
regions it is not a globe, but a body, the tip of which
is a globe only to gross vision, vision to which its continuation
is invisible.</p>

<p>Thirdly: the keener vision detects intermediate stages
before unseen, and shows a series of changes between
two which, to the less acute sight, were in immediate
sequence. Thus, in the earlier observations, it was said
that the ultimate physical atom broke up into astral
matter. When a similar phenomenon is studied twelve
years later, it is seen that the physical atom breaks up
into an immense number of inconceivably minute particles,
and that these immediately group themselves into
forty-nine astral atoms, which may or may not, again,
combine into astral molecules. Again, a whirling wall
was mentioned: keener vision sees no wall, but an illusory
enclosure, caused by rapid motion, like the fiery
circle traced by a whirling fire-tipped stick. So, in the
continuous light of gas or electricity, a whirling disk
of black and white rays shows grey; put out the lights,
and let the darkness be rent by a lightning-flash, the
disk hangs motionless, every black and white ray distinct.
Which is the true observation? The eye in each
case bears true witness to what it <em>sees</em>. The different
conditions impose upon it different visions.</p>

<p>Other differences also arise, but these may serve as
samples. Are, then, books relating to observations useless?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
They only become useless, even mischievous, when
the theosophical student treats them as revelations or
inspirations instead of as observations. Observation is
the basis of scientific knowledge; the correction of
earlier observations by later ones is the condition of
scientific progress. The student of optics, when confronted
with the black-and-white rayed disk, the grey
disk, the whirling disk hanging motionless, does not conclude
that the conflicting observations make observations
useless. He searches for and finds the conditions of
light, of the constitution of the eye, which explain the
equally true though contradictory reports. He submits
the observations to renewed experiment and to the
scrutiny of reason, until from the contradictions emerges
the many-sided truth.</p>

<p>What should be the attitude of the theosophical student
to books of observations? To all such books you
must take up the attitude of the scientific student, not
of the believer. You must bring to bear upon them a
bright intelligence, a keen mind, an eager intellect, a
thoughtful and critical reason. You must not accept as
final, observations made by other students, even though
those students are using faculties which you yourselves
have not as yet developed. You should accept them only
for what they are—observations liable to modification,
to correction, to reviewal. You should hold them with a
light grasp, as hypotheses temporarily accepted until
confirmed or negated by further observations, including
your own. If they illuminate obscurities, if they conduce
to sound morality, take them and use them; but
never let them become fetters to your mind, gaolers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
your thought. Study these books, but do not swallow
them; understand them, but hold your judgment in suspense:
these books are useful servants but dangerous
masters; they are to be studied, not worshipped. Make
your own opinions, do not borrow those of others; do
not be in such a hurry to know that you accept other
people’s knowledge, for ready-made opinions, like ready-made
clothes, are neither well-fitting nor becoming.</p>

<p>There is a dangerous tendency in the Theosophical
Society to make books of observations authoritative
instead of using them as materials for study. We must
not add to the number of blind believers who already
exist, but to the number of sane and sober students, who
patiently form their own opinions and educate their
own faculties. Use your own judgment on every observation
submitted to you; examine it as thoroughly
as possible; criticise it as fully as you can. It is a poor
service you do us when you turn students into popes,
and, parrot-like, repeat as authoritative, statements that
you do not know to be true. Moreover, blind belief is
the road to equally blind scepticism: you place a student
on a pedestal and loudly proclaim him to be a prophet,
despite his protests; and then, when you find he has
made some mistake, as he warned you was likely, you
turn round, pull him down, and trample on him. You
belabour him when you should belabour your own blindness,
your own stupidity, your own anxiety to believe.</p>

<p>Is it not time that we should cease to be children, and
begin to be men and women, realising the greatness of
our opportunities and the smallness of our achievements?
It is not time to offer to Truth the homage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
study instead of that of blind credulity? Let us ever

grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse
in a fair encounter?”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
